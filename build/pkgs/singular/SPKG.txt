* 20080105 William Stein -- Deleted LIB/surfex and modified LIB/all to not have surfex in it.
We should *not* ship and install precompiled java without thinking it through carefully and
understanding and testing it.

* 20070823 Juan M. Bello Rivas <jmbr@superadditive.com>
 + dropped dependencies on flex and bison

* 20070802 Martin Albrecht <malb@informatik.uni-bremen.de>
 + new upstream release (3-0-3)
 + adapted new spkg structure (all changes in patches subdirectory)

* 20070506 Martin Albrecht <malb@informatik.uni-bremen.de>
 + build script improvements
 + changes to libsingular.h

* 20070326 Martin Albrecht <malb@informatik.uni-bremen.de>
 + rewrote spkg-install
 + added first alpha of libsingular.so
 + removed stand-alone libfactory

* 20070105 William Stein
 + included Singular/Singular.rc.in which was missing for some
   reason and is needed by the cygwin build.

* 20060825 Martin Albrecht <malb@informatik.uni-bremen.de>
 + removed hannes-sprueche.txt (not funny anyway)
 + removed ntl subdirectory (we ship NTL already)
 + removed modules subdirectory (not needed)

* 20060831 William Stein and Justin Walker -- fine tuning
  for OS X.

* 20060831 William Stein -- put a lot of the workarounds from the previous
   Singular spkg-install script in here, since they are in fact needed
   in order for Singular to work after you type, e.g., make clean, or if
   you move the install directory.

* Martin Albrecht -- add fix to libcf:
Yes, It's a (new?) bug in libcf I've fixed just yesterday but got no word from
the Singular people yet. They free a char ptr they are not supposed to free
if I understand the ostrstring docs correctly. I've attached the
one-line-fixed int_poly.cc which belongs in the factory subdirectory of
Singular.

 * Martin Albrecht -- 2006-09-17:
This looks to me as if I didn't remove all references to boost:
/usr/include/boost/dynamic_bitset/dynamic_bitset.hpp:1098: error: exception
I've attached an updated configure.in and configure (created with autoconf
2.60) with Boost checks disabled which should fix the problem. These belong
in the Singular subdirectory:
   singular-3-0-2-2006-09-09/Singular
