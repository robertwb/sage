= Singular =

== Description ==

Singular is a computer algebra system for polynomial computations,
with special emphasis on commutative and non-commutative algebra,
algebraic geometry, and singularity theory.

== License ==

GPLv2 or GPLv3

== PKG Maintainers ==

Martin Albrecht <martinralbrecht@googlemail.com>

== Upstream Contact ==

decker@mathematik.uni-kl.de
http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/

== Dependencies ==

MPIR, NTL, Termcap, Readline and MPFR

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==
 Several patches are applied.
 * assert.h: logic seems to be broken on some platforms
 * src/Singular/libparse.cc and src/factory/configure touched
   to avoid attempts to regenerate these files. (See #9160 and #3158)

 Other notes
 * The option '--without-dynamic-kernel' is used on *all*
   systems with the exception of Linux. The online README at
   http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/svn/trunk/README says this should
   be used on Solaris, with no mention of it being necessary for
   OS X, or any other platform except Solaris.
 * The online readme says that CONFIG_SHELL should be set to /bin/bash
   on Solaris. This is not done currently. Since this does not build
   fully as a 64-bit application on Solaris, CONFIG_SHELL should be
   investigated as a possible cause later.

== ChangeLog ==

=== singular-3-1-1-4 (Martin Albrecht, 15th July 2010) ===
 * new upstream release
 * updated SPKG.txt

=== singular-3-1-1-3 (Martin Albrecht, 10th July 2010) ===
 * new upstream release
 * updated SPKG.txt
 * reverting name to reflect actual Singular version format

=== singular-3.1.0.4.p8  (David Kirkby, 30th June 2010) ===
 * #9397 "Resolve corrupted patches to permit Singular to build on Solaris x86/x64"
   A previous patch made to add a Singular target x86-SunOS has been overwritten
   by a later patch. I resolved these two issues, so the patch contained both changes
   A patch file, and a diff made from it were removed, so the patches directory has two
   less files than before.
 * #9397 Set CC="$CC -m64" and CXX="$CXX-m64" to force the -m64 flag to fully propogate
   thoughtout the Singular build process - otherwise it fails to do so. Setting
   CFALGS/CXXFLAGS is insufficient.

=== singular-3.1.0.4.p7  (Mitesh Patel, 8th June 2010) ===
 * #9185: Set an empty MAKEFLAGS variable before "make".  On OS X, at
   least, this fixes building multiple spkgs in parallel (cf. #8306).

=== singular-3.1.0.4.p6  (David Kirkby and Willem Jan Palenstijn, 6th June 2010) ===
 * All changes relate to ticket #9160
 * Added sections to SPKG.txt which the Sage Developers Guide should be
   present, but were not. These include Description, License,
   PKG Maintainers, Upstream Contact, Dependencies and
   Special Update/Build Instructions.
 * Added a couple of comments in the new "Special Update/Build
   Instructions" section about Solaris and the use of
   --without-dynamic-kernel option and CONFIG_SHELL.
 * Changed the name of package to singular-$version.$patchversion,
   as is common Sage practice, and not have a date of any
   update. Since this should be patch level 6, I've called it that.
 * Touched the file src/Singular/libparse.cc
   (Willem Jan Palenstijn)
 * Touched the file src/factory/configure
 * Removed the restriction that the OS needs to be OS X before
   a 64-bit build is attempted. (This still does not fully build
   64-bit on OpenSolaris, though it is closer to doing so.)
 * Move code associated with SAGE64 outside of the code for debugging.
 * Ensured $SAGE_LOCAL/include is the first CPPFLAG, so the
   Sage include files are included before others.
 * Removed code which attempted to disable the dynamic kernel on
   OS X in 64-bit mode, since the dynamic kernel was already disabled
   on all platforms except Linux. It was pointless doing it twice.

=== singular-3-1-0-4-20100214 (William Stein, February 14, 2010) ===
 * patch for Cygwin (trac 7338)

=== singular-3-1-0-4-20100120 (Martin Albrecht, January 20th, 2010) ===

=== singular-3-1-0-4-20090818.p0 (Georg S. Weber, September 24th, 2009) ===
 * added three missing /patches/*.diff files
 * change -O2 to -O0 on ia64 (see trac #6360 and #6240),
   original change: singular-3-1-0-2-20090618 (Craig Citro, June 18th, 2009)
 * Make a copy of install-sh and put in the same directory as spkg-install,
   SPKG.txt etc. For some reason, I believe one of the makefiles is looking
   in the wrong directory for install-sh. There are about 5 identical copies
   of this in the source. I'm not sure why there needs to be so many, and why
   even with 5 or so copile, one can't be found.
   Original change: singular-3-1-0-2-20090620.p0 (David Kirkby, July 19th, 2009)

 * fix memleak in kernel/longrat.cc

* 20080105 William Stein -- Deleted LIB/surfex and modified LIB/all to not have surfex in it.
We should *not* ship and install precompiled java without thinking it through carefully and
understanding and testing it.

* 20070823 Juan M. Bello Rivas <jmbr@superadditive.com>
 + dropped dependencies on flex and bison

* 20070802 Martin Albrecht <malb@informatik.uni-bremen.de>
 + new upstream release (3-0-3)
 + adapted new spkg structure (all changes in patches subdirectory)

* 20070506 Martin Albrecht <malb@informatik.uni-bremen.de>
 + build script improvements
 + changes to libsingular.h

* 20070326 Martin Albrecht <malb@informatik.uni-bremen.de>
 + rewrote spkg-install
 + added first alpha of libsingular.so
 + removed stand-alone libfactory

* 20070105 William Stein
 + included Singular/Singular.rc.in which was missing for some
   reason and is needed by the cygwin build.

* 20060825 Martin Albrecht <malb@informatik.uni-bremen.de>
 + removed hannes-sprueche.txt (not funny anyway)
 + removed ntl subdirectory (we ship NTL already)
 + removed modules subdirectory (not needed)
 + removed Tst subdirectory (not needed)
 + wrote (very simple) spkg-install from scratch

* 20060831 William Stein and Justin Walker -- fine tuning
  for OS X.

* 20060831 William Stein -- put a lot of the workarounds from the previous
   Singular spkg-install script in here, since they are in fact needed
   in order for Singular to work after you type, e.g., make clean, or if
   you move the install directory.

* Martin Albrecht -- add fix to libcf:
Yes, It's a (new?) bug in libcf I've fixed just yesterday but got no word from
the Singular people yet. They free a char ptr they are not supposed to free
if I understand the ostrstring docs correctly. I've attached the
one-line-fixed int_poly.cc which belongs in the factory subdirectory of
Singular.

 * Martin Albrecht -- 2006-09-17:
This looks to me as if I didn't remove all references to boost:
/usr/include/boost/dynamic_bitset/dynamic_bitset.hpp:1098: error: exception
I've attached an updated configure.in and configure (created with autoconf
2.60) with Boost checks disabled which should fix the problem. These belong
in the Singular subdirectory:
   singular-3-0-2-2006-09-09/Singular
