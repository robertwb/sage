# Script to prepare a PARI spkg for Sage.  This script is only for the
# package maintainer, not for building PARI during a Sage install.
# WARNING: This script will delete/overwrite files in this directory
# and its subdirectories!
#
# HOW TO MAKE THE SPKG:
# 1) ./spkg-make
# 2) rm -rf parigit    (For final distribution, not necessary for testing)
# 3) cd ..; sage --spkg pari-2.5.1.whatever_the_name_of_the_package_is
#
# If something goes wrong, try rm -rf parigit and try again.
#
# This script does the following:
# * If the directory parigit/ exists, it is assumed to be a git
#   repository of the PARI sources.  If it does not exist, the git
#   sources are automatically downloaded.  In any case, a specific
#   version is checked out.
# * If the file parigit/galdata.tgz does not exist, it is downloaded.
# * The same for the file parigit/seadata-small.tgz
# * PARI is configured and built in the parigit directory.  The built
#   executables are not needed, but some files generated in the
#   process (using bison for example) are needed.
# * The necessary files are copied from parigit/ to src/ using a
#   mechanism very similar to "make snapshot" from PARI.
# * The files parigit/galdata.tgz and parigit/seadata-small.tgz are
#   extracted.
