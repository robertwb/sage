Here is how to build a new version of the PARI SAGE spkg:

  1) Get the latest stable source code from
           http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/download.html
     (NOTE -- just like last time, at some point the devel version will be
              the way to go, since that's where all the bug fixes are.
        The PARI stable/devel model is complicated.)

  2) Extract the above code and make it the directory src in the current directory.

  3) Type ./spkg-dist in the above directory.

  4) Add any relevant remarks to SPKG.txt.

  5) Test the new spkg, which will be created in
     the directory:
          sage -f pari-2.3.1.spkg


-----------------------------------

* 2007-03-04: included Pablo De Napoli (denapo@gmail.com)'s
   improvement so PARI will build on systems with runpath support.
   See sage/runpath.txt for details.

* 2006-09-28: (William Stein and Justin Walker)
  Modified PARI build scripts so that they build the
  PARI *shared* library even under OS X, and on OS X intel
  they build the x86/gmp kernel.


* I took the standard PARI tarball, but ran the script spkg-dist on it
  to create this directory.  This script does various things to some
  of the PARI files to make them work better with SAGE, the most
  important being to replace calls to exit() with calls to abort().

* Also, I placed a directory "sage" in this directory with some files
  needed by spkg-install.

* This changed removed -- 09/28/2006
#* I changed a line of config/Makefile.SH to
#      DLLDFLAGS  = $DLLDFLAGS -mimpure-text


* Put the extra galois groups data files in the data/galdata subdirectory,
  so PARI can compute Galois groups up to bigger degree.

Note from David Kirby that could be relevant to building on Solaris:

9) Since pari is using -xarch=native, which implies -xarch=v8plusa on
my box, but I set -xarch=v8plus (without the last a), this probably
means there will be different types of object files and so they may
not link together.  Ick.  Feel free to tell me how to modify the
configure script.

I got around it by setting CFLAGS -xarch=v8plus myself, so they were
all the same. But it is not right. I have not looked at pari to see
exactly where it says native, but I would expact a grep to find it.
