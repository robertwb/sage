Details of which source files are patched in spkg-install, and why.
See below for information on files which used to be patched but are no
longer (do not delete that!)

======================================================================
Files patched as of pari-2.4.3.svn-12577.p4:
======================================================================

Configuration files:
* Configure: use "#!/usr/bin/env bash" instead of "#!/bin/sh"
* config/get_ld: cwitty: disable -rpath
* config/get_tests: John Cremona: disable testing of ellglobalred in
                    "make test-all" in spkg-check, since it requires
                    the elldata database which we do not include.
* config/get_dlcflags: Add -fno-common to DLCFLAGS on Darwin.
* config/Makefile.SH: Change "test -e" to "test -f" for Solaris.

Documentation:
* doc/gphelp.in: cwitty: disable TeX; allow bz2 compression

Header files:
* src/headers/paripriv.h: *after* building, on {OS X, SunOS, SYGWIN},
                          rename "ECHO"

C files:
* src/kernel/gmp/mp.c: needed so that Sage can catch pari's error signals.
* src/language/init.c: needed so that Sage can catch pari's error signals.
* src/basemath/base2.c and src/basemath/polarit3.c: fix PARI bug 1079.

======================================================================
Files previously patched:
======================================================================

* config/get_cc: on SunOS only, add "-fPIC" to compiler flags (David Kirkby)
  This happens not with a patch file, but with a sed command in
  spkg-install.  Now fixed upstream (-fPIC added on all platforms).

*config/get_dlcflags: mabshoff: To get around problem in PPC 32-bit
  Linux build.  Now fixed upstream (-fPIC added on all platforms).

* config/get_kernel: pjeremy: fix for FreeBSD: #7825.  Supposedly fixed
  upstream.

* config/get_dlld: Undocumented patch for Darwin.  Removed to see what
  happens...


* config/get_cc: changed OPTFLAG from "-O3" to "-O1" on Linux because of
problems on Fedora 11 (32-bit) with one gcc version (ticket #7092).

# Minh Van Nguyen: copy over patched get_cc (see ticket #7092). It's
# reported that 32-bit Fedora 11 would fail to build otherwise.
if [ `uname` = "Linux" ]; then
    cp "$TOP"/patches/get_cc config/get_cc
fi

* src/headers/paridecl.h: used to need a dummy variable changed from B0
  to N; now fixed upstream.
* src/headers/paripriv.h: used to need a dummy variable changed from B0
  to N; now fixed upstream.  NB There's another patch on this file still
  in place!
