== Releases ==

=== cvxopt-1.1.2.p1 (Dima Pasechnik, 26 July 2010) ===
 * incorporating building the GLPK extension (track #9598)

=== cvxopt-1.1.2 (Dima Pasechnik, 26 July 2010) ===
(as the previous iteration never made it into a release, the version
 number of the spkg stays the same)

 * implemented changes requested in comment 28 of track ticket #6456:
 <quite>
  1. I don't think there should be a patches-old directory...
  2. Files are modified in place in the src/ directory...
  3. In the patches directory, the patches should be unified diffs (diff -Naur).
  4. In spkg-install, you should just remove the old,
     unnecessary code instead of just commenting it out.
     Also, I don't think the SAGE_LOCAL check is necessary.

  (kept a harmless SAGE_LOCAL check)

   Also, added a check in spkg-install that the installation went OK.

   On building cvxopt extensions:
   the non-required extension are not built;
   however, it is possible to switch on the dsdp and dsl extensions by
   flipping the BUILD_..-flags in setup.py (and modifying dirs for dsdp)
   Remaining extensions were not tested; it should not be hard to have
   them provided the corresponding libs are there (e.g. parts of Sage)

=== cvxopt-1.1.2 (Harald Schilly, Jan 26th, 2010, Dima Pasechnik, Mar 2010) ===

 * modified setup.py to streamline and make it more Sage-like;
   in particular got rid of f77blas and f95 dependences that
   are obsolete, since Sage switched to gfortran
 * rebased Solaris-specific patches from cvxopt-0.9 spkg
   (only cvxopt.h needed to be patched, while the old
    native cvxopt random framework is now gone (since cvxopt-1.1
    at least)
 * removed examples and docs
 * modified setup.py and src/python/__init__.py
 * moved old patches to patches-old (solaris, ...) for future reference
 * added patch from http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6456#comment:6
 * simplifying spkg-install

=== cvxopt-0.9.p8 (Gonzalo Tornaria, June 19th, 2009) ===

 * Replace perl spkg-install with a bash one.

=== cvxopt-0.9.p7 (Michael Abshoff, September 24th, 2008) ===
 * Work around Solaris 10 problem with complex.h

== Old Comments, prior 1.1.2==

Against policy we patch some files in src/src/C

cholmod.c.patch
cvxopt.h.patch
random.c.patch

Those patches files conditionally include a patches version of Sun's complex.h - see http://bugs.opensolaris.org/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6549313

sun_complex.h

Depending on the Fortran compiler used we copy a different setup.py into the build directory:

setup_f95.py
setup_gfortran.py
