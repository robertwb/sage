OLD COMMENTS:

Against policy we patch some files in src/src/C

cholmod.c.patch
cvxopt.h.patch
random.c.patch

Those patches files conditionally include a patches version of Sun's complex.h - see http://bugs.opensolaris.org/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6549313

sun_complex.h

Depending on the Fortran compiler used we copy a different setup.py into the build directory:

setup_f95.py
setup_gfortran.py
