== Build Instructions ==

NEW COMMENTS for 1.1.2

== Dima Pasechnik (March 2010) ===

 * modified setup.py to streamline and make it more Sage-like;
   in particular got rid of f77blas and f95 dependences that
   are obsolete, since Sage switched to gfortran
 * rebased Solaris-specific patches from cvxopt-0.9 spkg
   (only cvxopt.h needed to be patched, while the old
    native cvxopt random framework is now gone (since cvxopt-1.1
    at least)
 * removed Ubuntu/Debian package specifics as irrelevant
   (none of their patches---they only patch setup.py anyway---
    survived)


== Harald Schilly (initial version, Jan 2010) ===

 * removed doc and examples directory
 * modified setup.py and src/python/__init__.py
 * old patches are in patches-old (solaris, ...)
 * original 1.1.2 cvxopt compiled, but on import it claimed
   cvxopt/base.so: undefined symbol: _g95_stop_blank
 * added patch from http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6456#comment:6

OLD COMMENTS:

Against policy we patch some files in src/src/C

cholmod.c.patch
cvxopt.h.patch
random.c.patch

Those patches files conditionally include a patches version of Sun's complex.h - see http://bugs.opensolaris.org/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6549313

sun_complex.h

Depending on the Fortran compiler used we copy a different setup.py into the build directory:

setup_f95.py
setup_gfortran.py
