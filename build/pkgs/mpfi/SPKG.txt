This is MPFI from http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/mpfi/

1. I have changed two functions:

First, mpfi_set_str() in mpfi/src/mpfi_io.c.
(The original version was very wrong; I fixed off-by-one errors, fixed
a buffer overflow, and fixed it so that it could return precise
intervals on precisely representable inputs, instead of always making
an interval containing two floats.)  The original version of the file
is at mpfi/src/mpfi_io.c.ORIG

Second, mpfi_diam_rel() in mpfi/src/mpfi.c: I changed line 598 from
    if (!mpfr_cmp_ui(centre,0))
to
    if (mpfr_cmp_ui(centre,0))

2. I (=William Stein) changed configure.ac to only build src and not tests or
doc, since building tests on some systems fails.  Of course, it would be
better to fix building of tests.  I put the changed version of configure.ac
in the patches directory.  After changing it, I ran
       autoreconf --force
in the src directory.

a. Fixed mpfi_ui_sub, by applying a patch posted by Paul Zimmerman to the
MPFI bug tracker.
b. Fixed the infinite loop in mpfi_cmp_sym_pi() (fixes the infinite loop
in mpfi_cos(), reported as MPFI bug# 1868 and Sage issue #389.
