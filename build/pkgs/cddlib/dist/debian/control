Description: Library for finding vertices of convex polytopes
 The C-library  cddlib is a C implementation of the Double Description
 Method of Motzkin et al. for generating all vertices (i.e. extreme points)
 and extreme rays of a general convex polyhedron in R^d given by a system
 of linear inequalities:
 .
   P = { x=(x1, ..., xd)^T :  b - A  x  >= 0 }
 .
 where  A  is a given m x d real matrix, b is a given m-vector
 and 0 is the m-vector of all zeros.
 .
 The program can be used for the reverse operation (i.e. convex hull
 computation).  This means that  one can move back and forth between
 an inequality representation  and a generator (i.e. vertex and ray)
 representation of a polyhedron with cdd.  Also, cdd can solve a linear
 programming problem, i.e. a problem of maximizing and minimizing
 a linear function over P.
