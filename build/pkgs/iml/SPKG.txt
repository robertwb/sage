== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

The following build instructions by William Stein might be incomplete and/or out of date:

 * I had to put the built version of src/repl in that directory, since on OS X it won't build. It's basically empty, so this seems safe.
 * I had to src/config/install-sh executable.
 * I had to create src/cblas.h since on many systems it isn't installed anywhere!? I just used gsl_cblas.h for this purpose, which seems to work fine.
 * Modified some of the examples, and made build scripts that work.
 * '''IMPORTANT''': Change lift to iml_lift in padiclift.* and nonsingsolve.*, since otherwise  on OSX you'll have horrible weird conflict problems.
