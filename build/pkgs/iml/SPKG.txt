Get it from

1. I had to put the built version of src/repl in that directory, since on OS X it won't build.
   It's basically empty, so this seems safe.

2. I had to src/config/install-sh executable.

3. I had to create src/cblas.h since on many systems it isn't installed anywhere!?
   I just used gsl_cblas.h for this purpose, which seems to work fine.

4. Modified some of the examples, and made build scripts that work.

5. *IMPORTANT*: Change lift to iml_lift in padiclift.* and nonsingsolve.*, since otherwise
   on OSX you'll have horrible weird conflict problems.
