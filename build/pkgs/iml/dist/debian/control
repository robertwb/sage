Description: Integer Matrix Library
 IML is a library for exact, dense linear algebra over the integers.
 More verbosely, it is a free library of C source code which implements
 algorithms for computing exact solutions to dense systems of linear
 equations over the integers. IML is designed to be used with the
 ATLAS/BLAS library and GMP bignum library.
 .
 Written in portable C, IML can be used on both 32-bit and 64-bit
 machines. It can be called from C++.
 .
 Currently, IML provides the following functionality:
 .
    * Nonsingular rational system solving: compute the unique
      rational solution X to the system AX=B, where A and B
      are integer matrices, A nonsingular.
    * Compute the right nullspace of an integer matrix.
    * Certified linear system solving: compute a minimal denominator
      solution x to a system Ax=b, where b is an integer vector and
      A is an integer matrix with arbitrary shape and rank profile.
 .
 In addition, IML provides some low level routines for a variety of
 mod p matrix operations: computing the row-echelon form, determinant,
 rank profile, and inverse of a mod p matrix. These mod p routines are
 not general purpose; they require that p satisfy some preconditions
 based on the dimension of the input matrix (usually p should be
 prime and should be no more than about 20 bits long).
