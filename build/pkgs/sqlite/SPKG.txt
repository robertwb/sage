SQLite
=== sqlite-3.5.3.p4 (David Kirkby, June 13th, 2009) ===
 * Fixed a bug that prevented sqlite building on the Sun T5240
 t2.math.washington.edu running Solaris 10 update 4 with gcc version
 4.4.0.

 Linking libpthread before libc caused the problem. Changing the order
 of linking avoided it, but is not easy to do, as the order is
 determined by libtool. However, libpthread is not necessary on Solaris
 10. There is *probably* a libtool bug that is the real cause. The bug
 fix is implemented by striping libpthread out of the Makefile with sed.

 Thanks are due to Nicolas Williams (Nicolas.Williams@sun.com) who made
 me aware libpthread was not necessary, as its functionality was moved
 to libc in Solaris 10, with libpthread only provided for backwards
 compatibility.
