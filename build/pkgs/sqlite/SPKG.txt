= SQLite =

SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained,
serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.

=== sqlite-3.6.17.p0 (Dan Drake, October 25th, 2009) ===

  * Remove obsolete Makefile.in "patch" for Cygwin, since the new sqlite
    source uses autoconf. Remove special Cygwin bits from spkg-install;
    we don't need the client on Cygwin, but we install it anyway.

=== sqlite-3.6.17 (David Kirkby, August 16th, 2009) ===
 * Update to the latest upstream source. This compiles without
   any issues on the Sun Studio 12 update 1. Previously
   sqlite needed to be hacked to even build with gcc on
   Solaris.
 * Remove Solaris specific hacks previously added, as they
   are no longer needed.
 * Added CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I $SAGE_LOCAL/include"
   and exported that, as it failed to find the header files
   otherwise.
 * Removed the without-tcl option, as this is no longer an option
   to the configure script on sqlite. It appears to work without
   tcl.
 * Changed the code to build with 64-bit to work on any platform, not
   just Darwin as before. Sets flags for 64-bit whenever SAGE64 is set to
   'yes' or '1'.
 * Prints a few messages showing the flags used for compilation.
 * Adds 'set -e' where appropiate and removes it with 'set +e' where
   appropiate. This should catch more errors.
 * Adds debugging information by default, but it can be removed by setting
   SAGE_DEBUG to 'no' or '0'

=== sqlite-3.5.3.p4 (David Kirkby, June 13th, 2009) ===
 * Fixed a bug that prevented sqlite building on the Sun T5240
 t2.math.washington.edu running Solaris 10 update 4 with gcc version
 4.4.0.

 Linking libpthread before libc caused the problem. Changing the order
 of linking avoided it, but is not easy to do, as the order is
 determined by libtool. However, libpthread is not necessary on Solaris
 10. There is *probably* a libtool bug that is the real cause. The bug
 fix is implemented by striping libpthread out of the Makefile with sed.

 Thanks are due to Nicolas Williams (Nicolas.Williams@sun.com) who made
 me aware libpthread was not necessary, as its functionality was moved
 to libc in Solaris 10, with libpthread only provided for backwards
 compatibility.

=== sqlite-3.5.3.p3 (Michael Abshoff, May 19th, 2008) ===
 * add 64 bit OSX build support

=== sqlite-3.5.3.p2 (William Stein, May 16th, 2008) ===
 * Fix Makefile so it works on Cygwin (simply disable building sqlite client)
 * Change spkg-install to use bash
