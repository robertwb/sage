Description: Givaro, a library for arithmetic and algebraic computations
 In the joint CNRS-INRIA / INPG-UJF project APACHE,
 Givaro is a C++ library for arithmetic and algebraic computations.
 .
 Its main features are implementations of the basic arithmetic of
 many mathematical entities: Primes fields, Extensions Fields,
 Finite Fields, Finite Rings, Polynomials, Algebraic numbers,
 Arbitrary precision integers and rationals (C++ wrappers over gmp)
 .
 It also provides data-structures and templated classes for the
 manipulation of basic algebraic objects, such as vectors, matrices
 (dense, sparse, structured), univariate polynomials (and therefore
 recursive multivariate).
 .
 It contains different program modules and is fully compatible with
 the LinBox linear algebra library and the Athapascan environment,
 which permits parallel programming.
 .

 .
 This version of Givaro is heavily modified for use with SAGE.
