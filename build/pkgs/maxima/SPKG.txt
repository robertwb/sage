== Description ==

Maxima is a system for the manipulation of symbolic and numerical
expressions, including differentiation, integration, Taylor series,
Laplace transforms, ordinary differential equations, systems of linear
equations, polynomials, and sets, lists, vectors, matrices, and
tensors. Maxima yields high precision numeric results by using exact
fractions, arbitrary precision integers, and variable precision
floating point numbers. Maxima can plot functions and data in two and
three dimensions.

== SPKG Maintainers ==

 * TBD

== Upstream Contact ==

 * The Maxima mailing list - see http://maxima.sourceforge.net/maximalist.html

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * Make sure the patches still apply cleanly.

 * Run the `spkg-dist` script after updating to a newer upstream
   release. It removes a large amount of unused documentation and
   disables the associated Makefiles, reducing the size of the SPKG
   greatly.

== Changelog ==

=== maxima-5.26.0 (Dima Pasechnik, February 28th 2012) ===
 * upgrading to version 5.26.0 to take care of #10682.
 * added patch/comm.patch to fix Maxima bug #3484414.
   (false) precedes the display output if display2d is set to false.

=== maxima-5.24.0.p0 (Michael Orlitzky, January 29th 2012) ===
 * Trac #12094: Version bump to prevent a regression with the
   abs_integrate package.
 * Allow installation of local docs via SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS.
 * Remove more unused documentation in spkg-dist.
 * Update SPKG.txt to clarify the need to run spkg-dist.
 * Fix a double negative in the spkg-install output.

=== maxima-5.23.2.p3 (Simon King, December 10th, 2011) ===
 * #12131: Use --libdir, to make the package work on openSUSE.

=== maxima-5.23.2.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, November 3rd 2011) ===
 * Trac #11966: Modification so that Sage will build on Lion.
   Actually the new patch isn't specific to MacOS X 10.7 / Lion,
   but necessary when building with the new ECL version from git
   (ecl-11.1.2.git.20111030.spkg, see #11884).
 * Reviewer changes: Clean up `spkg-install`.

=== maxima-5.23.2.p1 (William Stein, 31 October 2011) ===
 * Trac #11966: Modification so that Sage will build on Lion.

=== maxima-5.23.2.p0 (Jeroen Demeyer, 18 May 2011) ===
 * Trac #11348: Add infodir.patch to use the correct "infodir" when
   relocating the Sage install tree.

=== maxima-5.23.2 (David Kirkby, 10th Feb 2011) ===
 * #10773 Update Maxima to the latest upstream release.
 * Starting with this version we need to touch all html and info files
   in doc/info, otherwise they get regenerated which requires texinfo.

=== maxima-5.22.1 (Nils Bruin, Volker Braun, 28 October 2010) ===
 * Update to the latest upstream version.
 * Rewrote section to build maxima.fas (ecl library) for new ASDF
   (see Ticket #8645)

=== maxima-5.20.1.p0 (William Stein, 3 April 2010) ===
 * Artificially bump version number to force rebuild, due to Maxima being broken without
   doing so on upgrade.

=== maxima-5.20.1 (Karl-Dieter Crisman, 21st December 2009) ===
 * Upgrade to the latest upstream release
 * Removed patches - the solver is now in Maxima, and topoly.lisp is no longer used
 * Changed instructions below to not automatically assume spkg-dist, because this calls automake and sometimes this causes build failures due to version numbers (see Trac #7287)

=== maxima-5.19.1.p2 (Mike Hansen, Nils Bruin,  December 2nd, 2009) ===
 * Added building Maxima as an ecl library to spkg-install

=== maxima-5.19.1.p1 (Robert Marik, November 11th, 2009) ===
 * Added new CVS version for solve_rat_ineq.mac to close work on ticket #7325
   (Sage cannot solve inequalities)

=== maxima-5.19.1.p0 (Alex Ghitza, August 24th, 2009) ===
 * Added patch that works around bug in topoly.lisp by changing appropriate instances of parg to carg

=== maxima-5.19.1    (David Kirkby, 20th August 2009) ===
 * Upgrade to the latest upstream release

=== maxima-5.16.3.p2 (Michael Abshoff, May 15th, 2009) ===
 * Switch lisp used to ecl

=== maxima-5.16.3.p1 (Michael Abshoff, April 19th, 2009) ===
 * address review comment by Gonzalo

=== maxima-5.16.3.p0 (Michael Abshoff, April 18th, 2009) ===
 * create maxima-noreadline script for matching dynamically readline disabling clisp (#5662)

=== maxima-5.16.3 (Michael Abshoff, September 27th, 2008) ===
 * Upgrade to upstream

=== maxima-5.16.2.p0 (Michael Abshoff, September 16th, 2008) ===
 * Delete ~/.sage/maxima_commandlist_cache.sobj if it exists in spkg-install (fixes #4133)

=== maxima-5.16.2 (Michael Abshoff, August 21st, 2008) ===
 * Upgrade to upstream

=== maxima-5.13.0.p2 (Michael Abshoff) ===
 * due to fixing #1471 we need to tell maxima to use clisp.bin as clisp executable

ToDo:

Add history from hg

=============================================================

How to make a new version of the Maxima spkg.

  1. Go to http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4933
     and download the source tar.gz ball.  That's near the bottom
     of that page (i.e., hard to find if you don't scroll past
     all the big red adds).

  2. Extract the tarball to replace the src/ subdirectory of this package.

  3. Create an spkg from this directory, with
        sage -pkg maxima-x.y.z

  4. Test the resulting maxima-??.spkg.

=============================================================

Here's what spkg-dist does:

* Removes the foreign language versions of the info files,
  since they add several MEGS (and they weren't in previous
  versions of Maxima).  This means making empty directories
  and changing the Makefile.in's.

* In the past, before doing step 3 above, one would also type

       ./spkg-dist

  However, this caused problems with calling automake because
  of the changed .in files.
