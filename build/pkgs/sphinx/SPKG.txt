== Description ==

Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and
beautiful documentation for Python projects (or other documents
consisting of multiple reStructuredText sources), written by Georg
Brandl. It was originally created to translate the new Python
documentation, but has now been cleaned up in the hope that it will be
useful to many other projects.

== Changelog ==

=== 0.6.3.p4 (Minh Van Nguyen, 2009-12-31) ===

 * Patch src/sphinx/environment.py to prevent Sphinx from rebuilding
   a document again. Once a document is built and we make changes to
   it, Sphinx should not rebuild the full document, but only
   portion(s) of the document that have changed. The patch for
   src/sphinx/environment.py was suggested by Mitesh Patel.

=== 0.6.3.p3 (Mike Hansen, 2009-12-15) ===

 * Add an option to Sphinx to provide a function to get the argspecs
   of builtin functions.
