== Description ==

The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by
applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed
in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline
library includes additional functions to maintain a list of
previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those
lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * Deleted some files from the doc directory from the standard distro,
   since it took tons of space; didn't delete anything else.
 * Work around some MacOSX dynamic lib flags

== readline-6.0p2 (Tim Dumol, December 6th, 2009) ==
 * Add workaround for Arch Linux readline issues ("undefined symbol:
   PC") by copying over the system version.

=== readline-6.0.p0 (David Kirkby, November 29th, 2009) ===
 * Set the name of the dynamic library that gets copied to
   $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libreadline.sl.6 on the HP-UX platform.
   (HP-UX uses .sl for the extension of shared libraries)

=== readline-6.0 (William Stein and David Kirkby, Sept 16th, 2009) ===
 * Upgrade to 6.0 (latest upstream)
 * Remove numerous ugly build hacks needed only on OS X for older readline.
 * Track #6844 Made a test for /etc/SuSE-release, as the previous spkg-install
   greped on it, which generates a warning if the file does not exist,
   which it will not on most peoples systems.
 * Build 64-bit if SAGE64 is set to 'yes' on any platform (tested on
   OS X and Solaris SPARC)
 * Allow debug information to be removed from file, if
   SAGE_DEBUG is set to 'no', 'false' or '0'
 * Add a check that someone is not mixing the Sun and GNU compilers.
 * Checks SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB points to a file, if it is set.
 * Added 'set -e' so script will exit in case of error.
 * Print variable names (CC, CFLAGS etc) for information and to aid debugging.
