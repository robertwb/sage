== Description ==

The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by
applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed
in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline
library includes additional functions to maintain a list of
previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those
lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * Deleted some files from the doc directory from the standard distro,
   since it took tons of space; didn't delete anything else.
 * Work around some MacOSX dynamic lib flags
 * When self-tests are added upstream, we may have to set up
   variables like CFLAGS in the script spkg-check: imitate the
   settings in spkg-install.
 * In #11882, we turned off the fixes for Arch Linux and OpenSuSE by
   changing various tests in spkg-install from "if ..." to "if false
   && ...".  When Arch Linux or OpenSuSE are updated, modified
   versions of these tests may need to be reinstated.

== Changelog ==

=== readline-6.2.p1 (John Palmieri, 14 Oct 2011) ===
 * Add some notes to SPKG.txt (trac #11882).

=== readline-6.2.p0 (John Palmieri, 30 Sept 2011) ===
 * Update to version 6.2 (trac #11882).
 * Fix for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.  This fix is taken from
   https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/devel/readline/files/patch-shobj-conf.diff
 * spkg-install: Turn off all hacks and fixes for Arch Linux and OpenSuSE.
 * Use 'patch' to install the patches.

=== readline-6.1 (David Kirkby, 11th November 2010) ===
 * Update to latest version #9523
 * Removed a hack for Arch Linux, as this is no longer needed
   with the latest readline (see #9523)
 * Removed some commented out code from spkg-install - the file
   was big enough without even more things.
 * Removed checks that there was not a mix of Sun and
   GNU compilers. This is a bit pointless now, as
   the 'prereq' script does this.
 * Removed checks that SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB exits - again
   this is taken care of in one place, and does not need
   to be in every single .spkg file.
 * Removed reference to ABI, FCFLAGS and F77FLAGS since
   there's no Fortran in the Readline package, and no ABI
   to set.
 * Removed references to CXX and other C++ related items
   as there is no C++ code.
 * No longer check if SAGE64=1, since it can only be set to
   "yes" or "no", so restrict the check for "yes"
 * Removed a note that a 32-bit build was taking place if
   SAGE64 was not set to "yes" or "1". This was in
   inaccurate comment, as many systems build 64-bit by
   default, and so the comment is inaccurate on many systems.
   (Though of course it was harmless).
 * Removed an unnecessary semi-colon on the line
   echo "SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting"
   The semi-colon is on various .spkg files, and seems
   to be the result of a bit of code copied from one
   package to another.
 * Updated the file to patch support/shobj-conf (done for
   FreeBSD), since this file has changed in the latest source
   code for readline. This should be reported upstream if it
   has not already been done. It is pointless us patching
   a file every time, if there's a bug in it that could be
   solved in the upstream source code.
 * Add an spkg-check file, though it does nothing useful,
   as there are no self-tests. However, there is a 'check'
   target, so running 'make check' does not generate an
   error, but instead reports there is nothing to be done.
 * Removed set -e and set +e. Used properly these are useful,
   but used poorly they are likely to cause more problems than
   enough. So these have been removed, as it's clear they were
   not being used properly.
 * Added support for any compiler flag for 64-bit builds, using
   $CFLAG64
 * Use compiler options -g -O0 if SAGE_DEBUG=yes. Otherwise use
   -g -O2. Other options may be added too.
 * Removed the 'build' function as it was a bit pointless - it takes
   less characters to just put the code inline.
 * Tested exit code of 'configure', 'make' and 'make install'
   separately - no longer run "make install".
 * Used $MAKE instead of make, which will allow parallel builds
   but will need extensive testing.
 * Change name of library from libreadline.so.6.0 to
   libreadline.so.6.1 on OpenBSD. This seems logical, but is untested
   as I don't have an OpenBSD box around, and currently there's even
   less development going into OpenBSD than there is AIX or HP-UX!!

=== readline-6.0.p4 (Leif Leonhardy, October 28th, 2010) ===
 * #9530: Reviewer patch. Some clean-up, also making it more
   portable and robust. (Also fixes "set -e" preventing us to
   check exit codes and print appropriate error messages.)
   Now also supports Arch Linux with readline 5.x, then building
   Sage's version.
   Now does *not* build Sage's readline on OpenSuSE 11.x when
   the headers are missing (since this would break bash as well);
   instead, instruct the user to install OpenSuSE's devel version
   of libreadline 6.x, which contains these.
 * Except for the "set -e" issue (and an added error check), the
   changes again only affect Arch Linux and OpenSuSE.
 * Bumped the patch level again to avoid confusion.

=== readline-6.0.p3 (Thomas BÃ¤chler, Mitesh Patel, October 24th, 2010) ===
 * #9530: Update openSuSE and Arch Linux workarounds to fix failed
   builds. No changes that could affect other platforms.

=== readline-6.0.p2 (Mike Hansen, June 22nd, 2010) ===
 * #7821: readline-6.0.p1 fails on FreeBSD

=== readline-6.0.p1 (Tim Dumol, December 6th, 2009) ===
 * #7610: Add workaround for Arch Linux readline issues ("undefined
   symbol: PC") by copying over the system version.

=== readline-6.0.p0 (David Kirkby, November 29th, 2009) ===
 * Set the name of the dynamic library that gets copied to
   $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libreadline.sl.6 on the HP-UX platform.
   (HP-UX uses .sl for the extension of shared libraries)

=== readline-6.0 (William Stein and David Kirkby, Sept 16th, 2009) ===
 * Upgrade to 6.0 (latest upstream)
 * Remove numerous ugly build hacks needed only on OS X for older readline.
 * Track #6844 Made a test for /etc/SuSE-release, as the previous spkg-install
   greped on it, which generates a warning if the file does not exist,
   which it will not on most peoples systems.
 * Build 64-bit if SAGE64 is set to 'yes' on any platform (tested on
   OS X and Solaris SPARC)
 * Allow debug information to be removed from file, if
   SAGE_DEBUG is set to 'no', 'false' or '0'
 * Add a check that someone is not mixing the Sun and GNU compilers.
 * Checks SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB points to a file, if it is set.
 * Added 'set -e' so script will exit in case of error.
 * Print variable names (CC, CFLAGS etc) for information and to aid debugging.

=== readline-5.2.p7 (Mike Hansen, June 19th, 2009) ===
 * Applied Peter Jeremy's fix from #5874.

=== readline-5.2.p6 (Michael Abshoff, February 2nd, 2009) ===
 * Deal with 64 bit OpenSUSE 11.1 (#4946)

=== readline-5.2.p5 (Michael Abshoff, January 5th, 2009) ===
 * Deal with OpenSUSE 11.1 (#4843)

=== readline-5.2.p4 (Arnaud Bergeron, September 3rd, 2008) ===
 * add a fix to find the dynamic library file on OpenBSD

=== readline-5.2.p3 (Michael Abshoff, May 18th, 2008) ===
 * add 64 bit OSX build support

=== readline-5.2.p2 (William Stein, May 16, 2008)  ===
 * /usr/bin/env bash;  change == to =; add support for cygwin; improve error messages and checking

=== readline-5.2.p1 (Craig Citro) ===
 * add fix for OSX 10.5 from Pari FAQ, where readline wasn't building
 a dynamic library

=== readline-5.2.p0 (Michael Abshoff) ===
 * set correct permissions on libreadline.so* and libhistory.so* (#1752)

=== readline-5.2 ===
 * changes lost to history - please let us know if you have any details.
