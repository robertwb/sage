== Description ==

This is a stripped-down version of GAP.  The databases, which are architecture-
independent, are in a separate package and doc and tests are removed.

As of GAP 4.4.12.p6, the tests and documentation (pre-built HTML and LaTeX
sources) are included again.  (Not sure whether all of this intentionally.)

== SPKG Maintainers ==

 * William Stein
 * Robert Miller
 * David Joyner
 * Dmitrii Pasechnik
 * Martin Albrecht
 * Volker Braun

== Upstream Contact ==

David Joyner, wdjoyner@gmail.com (on the GAP team, but
Steve Linton, sal@dcs.st-and.ac.uk, is basically the lead developer)

== Dependencies ==

 * readline (according to spkg/standard/deps)
 * Sage (? also according to deps, "so that gap_reset_workspace works")

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * TODO:
   - Perhaps check whether we can fix GAP's configure / build scripts
     w.r.t. brokenness of multiple words in `CC` (and `CXX`?) and its
     ignorance concerning `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`.

 * Do we really want to copy everything from the build directory???
   You need the full GAP tree to compile/install many GAP packages.

 * There's apparently a command missing (in `spkg-install`) building the
   (HTML?) documentation.  Earlier changelog entries as well as the description
   above state the documentation was removed from the upstream sources...
   Since the (pre-)built HTML documentation is currently included, I've
   commented out some lines in that part of `spkg-install`. -leif

 * Upon upgrading, check whether the build still fails when `CC` or `CXX`
   contain spaces (or multiple words, as e.g. with `CC="ccache gcc"`).
   Otherwise unsetting `CC` and `CXX` can be removed, which is an odd work-
   around anyway.

This is a stripped-down version of GAP.  The databases, which are arch
independent, are in a separate package and doc and tests are removed.

** IMPORTANT **:
   When you update this package, be sure to put the guava package
   in the package directory!!

Delete some of the documentation:
  cd doc
  rm *.bbl *.aux *.dvi *.idx *.ilg *.l* *.m* *.pdf *.toc  *.blg *.ind
  rm */*.bbl */*.aux */*.dvi */*.idx */*.ilg */*.l* */*.m* */*.pdf */*.ind */*.toc */*.blg

DATABASES (separated out to database_gap.spkg) except GAPDoc which is required:
  rm -rf small prim trans
  cd pkg
  rm -rf !(GAPDoc*)

Stuff that isn't GAP sources:
  rm -rf bin/*
  cd extern
  rm -rf !Makefile.in

=== gap-4.5.5 (Volker Braun, 26 August 2012) ===
 * Update to latest upstream version
 * New (saner) filesystem layout, everything goes to
   "$SAGE_LOCAL/gap/gap-x.y.z" with a "latest" symlink.
 * Added spkg-check

=== gap-4.4.12.p8 (Jean-Pierre Flori, Leif Leonhardy, 5 August 2012) ===
 * #13341: Only create symbolic link to gap.exe on Cygwin if needed.

=== gap-4.4.12.p7 (Leif Leonhardy, March 22nd 2012) ===
 * #7041: Only unset `CC` and `CXX` if really necessary (i.e., if they
   contain spaces, which is what currently would break the build).
 * Clean up `spkg-install`.  Some things seem still weird, see comments.

=== gap-4.4.12.p6 (Jeroen Demeyer, 8 August 2011) ===
 * Trac #11661: Make all files world-readable
 * Remove obsolete dist directory and spkg-debian script

=== gap-4.4.12.p5 (Jason Grout, 22 Feb 2011) ===

   $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/

=== gap-4.4.12.p4 (David Kirkby, 14th June 2010) ===
 * #9098 "gap buillds 32-bit on OpenSolaris when SAGE64=yes"
   Change spkg-install to allow gap to build 64-bit on Solaris.
   The changes are only for Solaris, since there are numerous
   warnings that setting CC causes problems. Note, this will not
   built 64-bit on OS X by setting the SAGE64 variable to "yes".

=== gap-4.4.12.p3 (Willem Jan Palenstijn, 2010-4-28) ===
 * #8773: Fix some problems with strict aliasing (gcc 4.5)
 * Don't pre-apply saveload.patch to src/ directory.
 * Remove some files in src/tst which seemed to have been copied from src/

=== gap-4.4.12.p2 (Dima Pasechnik, 2010-4-27) ===
 * removed everything in src/bin/ (Windows/Cygwin-less related stuff,
   i.e. not needed if full-blown Cygwin is used),
   and GAP 4 PPC (a MacOS 9 executable) in src/

=== gap-4.4.12.p1 (Dima Pasechnik, 2010-1-25) ===
 * See ticket #8076 for full details.
 * Added .hgignore.
 * Applied Steve Linton's Itanium patch to GAP_ROOT/src/saveload.c
   (not using the usual patches/* procedure, as this is
   an upstream patch.)
 *  Removed a stray binary file "patch" at the top level.
 *  Replaced $LN, $MKDIR, etc as done in gap-4.4.10.p13 (see below)

=== gap-4.4.12.p0 (David Joyner, 2009-6-17) ===
 * Upgraded to gap-4.4.12. Removed guava compilation. From the source
   GAP tarball, removed tomlib, small, prim, trans.

 * #7873 Remove references to $LN, $MKIDR and $RM and replace
   with ln, mkdir and rm, as agreed at
   http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/bd7ae07a1157be
ad/970aa0dc8fa56ab7?lnk=raot

=== gap-4.4.10.p12 (William Stein, June 2, 2009) ===

   before to do this.

=== gap-4.4.10.p11 (Michael Abshoff, September 20th, 2008) ===
 * Delete all old GAP installs due to a downgrade from GAP 4.4.12 (#5697)

 * Apply all the itanium patches to the src/ directory.
   These are from http://www.gap-system.org/Faq/Hardware-OS/hardware-os8.html
   and will be in *all* future versions of Gap (i.e., they come
   from upstream).  They change about 10 files, so I didn't not
   use our usual patches/* and copy protocol.

=== gap-4.4.10.p8 (Michael Abshoff, June 16th, 2008) ===
 * unset CC in spkg-install (work around for #2575)

=== gap-4.4.10.p6 (David Joyner, April 11th, 2008) ===

=== gap-4.4.10.p0 ===

Upgraded to gap-4.4.10.  Had to change files in the patches directory that
hard code gap-4.4.9.
