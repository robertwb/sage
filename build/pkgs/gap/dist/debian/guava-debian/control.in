Description: Coding theory library for GAP
 GUAVA is a package that implements coding theory algorithms in
 GAP. Codes can be created and manipulated and information about codes
 can be calculated.
 .
 GUAVA consists of various files written in the GAP language, and an
 external program from J.S. Leon for dealing with automorphism groups
 of codes and isomorphism testing functions.  Several algorithms that
 need the speed are integrated in the GAP kernel.
