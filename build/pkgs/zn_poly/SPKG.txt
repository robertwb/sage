= zn_poly =

== Description ==

zn_poly is a C library for polynomial arithmetic in Z/nZ[x], where n is any
modulus that fits into an unsigned long.

== License ==

GPL V2 or V3.  Some of the code has been copied from other projects - see
the file src/COPYING for details.

== SPKG Maintainers ==

 * David Harvey

== Upstream Contact ==

 * David Harvey

== Dependencies ==

 * GMP/MPIR
 * (some) Python (to create the Makefile)
 * GNU patch
 * NTL apparently only if we configured zn_poly differently (same for FLINT)

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==
 * Make sure the patches still apply.
   Especially changes in `makemakefile.py` may also require changes to
   `spkg-install` (and perhaps also `spkg-check`).
 * Don't forget to change the (shared library) version number(s) in
   `spkg-install` in case it changed; the current one is `0.9`.
   (TODO: Just take the version from upstream automatically instead of
    hardcoding it; it's [currently] in `src/VERSION`.)
 * Although this is configured with `--ntl-prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL"`,
   apparently NTL is only used if specific targets are created, so this
   can probably be removed. (Did so. -leif 04/2012)
 * There's also a `--use-flint` option to `configure`; no idea what it does,
   and we currently don't use it either.
 * TODO:
   - Use `make install` instead of manually "installing" (copying and sym-
     linking) the [shared] libraries and header files.  This requires further
     tweaking of `makemakefile.py`, since it currently only installs a static
     library and the headers.
   - If everything's fine, i.e., no problems arise, some comments and especial-
     ly some code I currently just commented out can certainly be removed.

== Changelog ==

=== zn_poly-0.9.p7 (Leif Leonhardy, April 8th, 2012) ===
 * #12433: Reviewer changes.
 * Restore upstream sources. (One file in `src/tune/` was already patched.)
 * Remove the obsolete Debian `dist/` directory.
 * Use `patch` to apply the patches.
 * Remove `patches/` from `.hgignore`! (And remove the prepatched files.)
 * Add Python to the dependencies, since (some) Python is needed to create
   the Makefile during build / `configure`.  (`spkg/standard/deps` already
   reflects this.)
 * Rework (upstream's) `makemakefile.py` to create a proper Makefile,
   respecting `CC`, `CXX`, `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS` etc. with their
   *usual* meaning (i.e., not using `CPP` to compile C++!), and using `LDFLAGS`
   consistently, also not hardcoding e.g. `-m64` (which was added by Sage).
 * Do not add `-O3` to `CFLAGS` (in `spkg-install`) without the possibility to
   get overridden by user-provided `CFLAGS`.  Also honor `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` by
   completely disabling optimization in that case.
 * Fix typo in `spkg-check`, which certainly would break building the test
   program when `SAGE64=yes`.  (Although it is actually already built from
   within `spkg-install`.)
 * Clean up `spkg-install` and `spkg-check`; redirect error messages to
   `stderr`, add more error checks, use `$MAKE` in `spkg-check` as well,
   quote more environment variables, use `cp [-f]` instead of `$CP`, don't
   create an absolute symbolic link on Cygwin.

=== zn_poly-0.9.p6 (R. Andrew Ohana, February 4th, 2012) ===
 * #12433: Make spkg respect global CC flag

=== zn_poly-0.9.p5 (David Kirkby, July 14th, 2010) ===
 * #9358 Ensure that spkg-install can handle the case
   of where SAGE64=yes and Solaris with a Sun linker. Previously
   this worked properly if SAGE64 was yes, OR if the operating system
   was Solaris with the sun linker. But spkg-install failed
   to work properly if both SAGE64=yes AND the operating system
   was Solaris with the Sun linker.
 * No longer run 'make check' from spkg-check. Since this was quick to run
   it has already been run from spkg-install, so it was pointless running
   it from spkg-check too. Instead a much more comprehensive test suite is
   run, using
   $ test/test all
 * Change the dependancy from GMP to MPIR in this SPKG.txt file, as Sage no
   longer uses GMP.

=== zn_poly-0.9.p4 (Willem Jan Palenstijn, William Stein, April 26th, 2010) ===
 * Ticket #8711: Fix build error on gcc 4.5, and check if make tune succeeded.
 * Added more checks for errors in spkg-install.

=== zn_poly-0.9.p3 (Jaap Spies, February 21th, 2010) ===
 * Ticket #8178: if SAGE64=yes we set CFLAGS appropriate. In patches/makemakefile.py we add $(LDFLAGS)
   when we build the shared library. This works for Darwin and Open Solaris.


=== zn_poly-0.9.p2 (Mike Hansen, February 15th, 2010) ===
 *  Ticket #8280: cygwin: zn_poly shared library named incorrectly on cygwin

=== zn_poly-0.9.p1 (David Kirkby, June 29th, 2009) ===
 *  Ticket #6443 A GNUism in zn_poly-0.9.p0 causes linking problems wiith Sun's linker
    This was an easy fix - just substitue -soname for -h in src/makemakefile.py
    I did this with a sed script in spkg-install

=== zn_poly-0.9.p0 (Michael Abshoff, September 26th, 2008) ===
 * remerge OSX 64 bit fixes
 * clean up spkg-install

=== zn_poly-0.9 (David Harvey and Timothy Abbott, September 19th, 2008) ===
 * updated to zn_poly-0.9
 * shared versioning filename issues
 * re-enabled test suite (now only takes ~10 seconds)
 * updated upstream URL

=== zn_poly-0.8.p2 (Michael Abshoff, August 19th, 2008) ===
 * Add 64 bit OSX build support

=== zn_poly-0.8.p1 (Michael Abshoff, June 9th, 2008) ===
 * Do not run the test suite per default any more (#3386)

=== zn_poly-0.8.p0 (David Harvey, April 4th, 2008) ===
 * updated to zn_poly-0.8 (fix minor bugs and memleaks)
 * updated SPKG.txt

=== zn_poly-0.8 (David Harvey, April 2nd, 2008) ===
 * updated to zn_poly-0.8.alpha0
 * updated SPKG.txt
 * changed spkg-install to run tuning program, test suite

=== zn_poly-0.4.1.p0 (Michael Abshoff, March 19th, 2008) ===
 * updated SPKG.txt
 * add hg repo, hg ignore
 * cleaned up spkg-install

=== zn_poly-0.4.1 (David Harvey, Dec. 18th, 2007) ===
 * created spkg from zn_poly-0.4.1
