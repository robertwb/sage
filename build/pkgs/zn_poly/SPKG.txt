 * Although this is configured with --ntl-prefix=$SAGE_LOCAL,
   apparently NTL is only used if specific targets are created, so this
   can probably be removed.

== Changelog ==


=== zn_poly-0.9.p5 (David Kirkby, July 14th, 2010) ===
 * #9358 Ensure that spkg-install can handle the case
   of where SAGE64=yes and Solaris with a Sun linker. Previously
   this worked properly if SAGE64 was yes, OR if the operating system
   was Solaris with the sun linker. But spkg-install failed
   to work properly if both SAGE64=yes AND the operating system
   was Solaris with the Sun linker.
 * No longer run 'make check' from spkg-check. Since this was quick to run
   it has already been run from spkg-install, so it was pointless running
   it from spkg-check too. Instead a much more comprehensive test suite is
   run, using
   $ test/test all
 * Change the dependancy from GMP to MPIR in this SPKG.txt file, as Sage no
   longer uses GMP.

=== zn_poly-0.9.p4 (Willem Jan Palenstijn, William Stein, April 26th, 2010) ===
 * Ticket #8711: Fix build error on gcc 4.5, and check if make tune succeeded.
 * Added more checks for errors in spkg-install.

=== zn_poly-0.9.p3 (Jaap Spies, February 21th, 2010) ===
 * Ticket #8178: if SAGE64=yes we set CFLAGS appropriate. In patches/makemakefile.py we add $(LDFLAGS)
   when we build the shared library. This works for Darwin and Open Solaris.


=== zn_poly-0.9.p2 (Mike Hansen, February 15th, 2010) ===
 *  Ticket #8280: cygwin: zn_poly shared library named incorrectly on cygwin

=== zn_poly-0.9.p1 (David Kirkby, June 29th, 2009) ===
 *  Ticket #6443 A GNUism in zn_poly-0.9.p0 causes linking problems wiith Sun's linker
    This was an easy fix - just substitue -soname for -h in src/makemakefile.py
    I did this with a sed script in spkg-install

 * updated upstream URL

=== zn_poly-0.8.p1 (Michael Abshoff, June 9th, 2008) ===
 * Do not run the test suite per default any more (#3386)
