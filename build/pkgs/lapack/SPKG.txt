== Description ==
Linear Algebra PACKage
http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
Fortran90 routines for solving systems of simultaneous
linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations,
eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. The associated matrix
factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are also
provided, as are related computations such as reordering of the Schur
factorizations and estimating condition numbers. Dense and banded matrices are
handled, but not general sparse matrices. In all areas, similar functionality
is provided for real and complex matrices, in both single and double precision.
