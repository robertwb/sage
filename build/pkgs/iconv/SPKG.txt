== Changelog ==

=== iconv-1.13.1.p3 (David Kirkby, August 10th, 2010) ===
 * No longer assume bash is in /bin, as it is not on HP-UX or AIX.
   Instead use "#!/usr/bin/env bash", as suggested in the
   Sage Developers Guide.
 * Install iconv on HP-UX in addition to the two platforms iconv was
   previously installed on (Solaris and Cygwin).
 * Additionally force make-check to execute on HP-UX.
 * Change the format of the tests in spkg-install and
   spkg-check to be a little clearer.
 * Add a few extra comments.
 * Removed code to remove old files, to avoid causing any confusion.
 * Quoted "$SAGE_LOCAL" where this had been omitted before
 * Removed trailing white space on lines.
 * Removed a surplus ; in both spkg-check and spkg-install.
 * Added the "Upstream Contact" section to SPKG.txt
 * Changed the "Special Update/Build Instructions" to be "none",
   as what was written before was confusing.

=== iconv-1.13.1.p2 (John Palmieri, March 31st 2010) ===
 * spkg-check: only run 'make check' on Solaris and Cygwin.

=== iconv-1.13.1.p1 (William Stein, March 31st 2010) ===
 * Really ensure iconv spkg only does something on Solaris and Cygwin.
   In particular, don't delete old versions thus breaking everybody's
   upgrades.

=== iconv-1.13.1.p0 (David Kirkby, March 21st 2010) ===
 * #8567 Ensure iconv only builds on Solaris and Cygwin as
   having two copies of iconv causes problems on some Linux systems.

=== iconv-1.13.1 (David Kirkby, February 13th 2010) ===
 * #8191 First release of libiconv, needed for R on Solaris
   and probably for Cygwin too (see #7319)
