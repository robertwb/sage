== Description ==

Cython is a language that makes writing C extensions for the Python language as
easy as Python itself. Cython is based on the well-known Pyrex, but supports
more cutting edge functionality and optimizations.

The Cython language is very close to the Python language, but Cython additio-
nally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables and class
attributes. This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C code from
Cython code.

This makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping for external C libraries, and
for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.
