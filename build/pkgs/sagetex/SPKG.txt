and plots from Sage into LaTeX documents.

== Dependencies ==

To install, nothing more than a standard Sage install. The
{{{spkg-check}}} script will likely fail unless a complete (or nearly
complete) Sage installation is available, as it attempts to run Sage on
the {{{.sage}}} files associated with the documentation and the provided
example.

Of course, to fully ''use'' SageTeX, one needs a modern TeX
distribution.

== Notes ==

To use SageTeX, both Sage and LaTeX need to know about it. If you have
installed this spkg, then Sage knows about SageTeX; now you need to make
LaTeX aware of it. The easiest thing to do is to copy a directory to a
{{{texmf}}} directory in your home directory. For Linux/Unix users, do
{{{
  cp -r $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/ $HOME/texmf/
}}}
For OS X users with MacTeX:
{{{
  cp -r $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/ $HOME/Library/texmf/
}}}
After you've copied over the necessary files, you'll need to update
TeX's database so that it can find them. Run "{{{texhash $HOME/texmf}}}"
(replace the texmf directory as appropriate) to do this.

The directory {{{$SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/tex/generic/sagetex}}}
contains documentation and an example file. If you have problems or
suggestions see [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support|the
sage-support group]].
