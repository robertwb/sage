== Description ==

fpLLL-3.0.7  contains different implementations of the floating-point LLL reduction algorithm, offering different speed/guarantees ratios. It contains a 'wrapper' choosing the estimated best sequence of variants in order to provide a guaranteed output as fast as possible. In the case of the wrapper, the succession of variants is oblivious to the user.
