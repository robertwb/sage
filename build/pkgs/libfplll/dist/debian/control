Description: A library for LLL-reduction of euclidean lattices
 fpLLL contains different implementations of the floating-point LLL
 reduction algorithm, offering different speed/guarantees ratios. It
 contains a 'wrapper' choosing the estimated best sequence of variants
 in order to provide a guaranteed output as fast as possible. In the
 case of the wrapper, the succession of variants is oblivious to the
 user.
 .
 From wikipedia: The Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz lattice basis reduction (LLL)
 is a polynomial time lattice reduction algorithm. Given as input d
 lattice basis vectors with n-dimensional integer coordinates and a
 norm lesser than B, the LLL algorithm outputs an LLL-reduced
 (short, nearly orthogonal) lattice basis in time
 .
    O(d^5 n log^3(B))
