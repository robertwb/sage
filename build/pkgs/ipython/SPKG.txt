== Description ==
From the IPython website:

IPython is a multiplatform, Free Software project (BSD licensed) that offers:

 * An enhanced Python shell designed for efficient interactive work. It includes many enhancements over the default Python shell, including the ability for controlling interactively all major GUI toolkits in a non-blocking manner.
 * A library to build customized interactive environments using Python as the basic language (but with the possibility of having extended or alternate syntaxes).
 * A system for interactive distributed and parallel computing (this is part of IPython's new development).

=== Patches ===
 * src/IPython/rlineimpl.py: We disable the check for libedit which
   caused "sage -gdb" not to work under OS X.  This was trac ticket
   #4991.
 * src/IPython/ultraTB.py: We add two lines which cause IPython not to
   print blank lines for frames in tracebacks that occur within Cython
   extensions. This was trac ticket #5051.
