== Description ==

The GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) package is intended for solving large-scale linear programming (LP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and other related problems. It is a set of routines written in ANSI C and organized in the form of a callable library.

GLPK supports the GNU MathProg modeling language, which is a subset of the AMPL language.

The GLPK package includes the following main components:

    * primal and dual simplex methods
    * primal-dual interior-point method
    * branch-and-cut method
    * translator for GNU MathProg
    * application program interface (API)
    * stand-alone LP/MIP solver

== License ==

The GLPK package is part of the GNU project, released under the aegis of GNU.
