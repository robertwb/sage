== Description ==

There are several programs for working with Rubik's cubes, by three
different people. Look inside the directories under /src to see
specific info and licensing. In summary the three contributers are:


Michael Reid (GPL) http://www.math.ucf.edu/~reid/Rubik/optimal_solver.html
    optimal - uses many pre-computed tables to find an optimal
              solution to the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube


Dik T. Winter (MIT License)
    cube    - uses Kociemba's algorithm to iteratively find a short
              solution to the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube
    size222 - solves a 2x2x2 Rubik's cube


Eric Dietz (GPL) http://www.wrongway.org/?rubiksource
    cu2   - A fast, non-optimal 2x2x2 solver
    cubex - A fast, non-optimal 3x3x3 solver
    mcube - A fast, non-optimal 4x4x4 solver
