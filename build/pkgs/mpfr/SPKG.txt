== Description ==

From http://mpfr.org/: The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision
floating-point computations with correct rounding. MPFR has continuously been
supported by the INRIA and the current main authors come from the CACAO and
Arenaire project-teams at Loria (Nancy, France) and LIP (Lyon, France)
respectively; see more on the credit page. MPFR is based on the GMP
multiple-precision library.

== Changelog ==

=== mpfr-2.3.0.p2 - Jan. 15th, 2008 -  Michael Abshoff ===
 * integrate r5186 from trunk at
   http://gforge.inria.fr/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/trunk/?root=mpfr
   This fixes an issue in mpfr where it would use alloca instead
   of the allocation function provided by GMP (which theses
   days is anything but alloca() due to limited stack on most
   system. Against policy I did patch mpfr-gmp.[c|h] directly
   since we will update to MPFR 2.3.1 once it is out shortly
   anyway.

=== mpfr-2.3.0.p1 - Nov. 15th, 2007 -  Michael Abshoff ===
 * patched sources in place to 2.3.0-p4
   (see http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/patches)

=== mpfr-2.3.0 - Sept. 14th, 2007 - Michael Abshoff ===
 * upgrade to mpfr 2.3.0 release
 * add spkg-check
