* 20070106 (William Stein):
   Modified mercurial/util.py to more intelligently choose the encoding,
   since this was crashing the install on my sage.math chroot jail.

* no changes from default repo, except that there's a sage
  subdirectory with a better .css file that gets copied to
  templates/static during the install.  And another
  that gets copied to templates/.

* Ran this command in the templates directory:

    replace ">manifest<" ">browse all files<" *.tmpl

  I mean, it's *incredibly* unclear what the hecke the
  "manifest" button is supposed to do.

* 20071020 (Carl Witty):
   Upgraded to mercurial 0.9.5.

*  Modified mercurial/util.py to skip looking in /etc/mercurial .
