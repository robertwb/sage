=== 20070106 (William Stein) ===
 * Modified mercurial/util.py to more intelligently choose the encoding, since this was crashing the install on my sage.math chroot jail.
 * no changes from default repo, except that there's a sage subdirectory with a better .css file that gets copied to templates/static during the install.  And another that gets copied to templates/.
 * Ran this command in the templates directory: "replace ">manifest<" ">browse all files<" *.tmpl". I mean, it's *incredibly* unclear what the hecke the "manifest" button is supposed to do.
