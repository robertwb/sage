Changes made from standard distro:


  * During the build process one of the following patches may be applied automatically:

          * PowerPC OS X: apply the gmp_add_nc.patch to fix a bug in the build
            process that is a show stopper under PowerPC OS X.  (This
            bug was introduced in gmp-6.2.1.)

          * The Intel Core 2 Duo 64-bit patch of Jason Martin:
                    http://www.math.jmu.edu/~martin/

          * Gaudry's speedups for AMD 64:
                    http://www.loria.fr/~gaudry/mpn_AMD64/

  * A patch is applied to incorporate GMP's fast GCD/XGCD code, which
    probably won't get officially released until GMP 5. The underlying
    code was obtained from http://gmplib.org/devel/ on 6-Sep-2007, which
    says that the author is Niels Moller, and it's licensed under GPL
    (apparently *not* all under LGPL). David Harvey wrote the patch to
    include it in SAGE's GMP build.

============================

NOTE: When upgrading GMP, don't forget to update the spkg-install
script for polymake.

LOG

------------------------

2006-02-19:
   Joe Weening completely rewrote the spkg-install file.

--------------------

(Submitted by Wilson Cheung)
   The following is really a gmp-4.1.4 "bug" when compiled under
   Solaris 10, and not a problem with sage itself.  In the section of
   gmp's "configure" that determines which valid values for "ABI" are
   available for each OS, it only checks up to Solaris 2.9.

   On Solaris 10, it thinks that "ABI=64" value is invalid since it
   just falls through to the default ABI choice of "standard".  This
   problem may already be fixed in GMP 4.1.5 development code or newer
   (haven't checked).

---------------------

2006-01-18 -- Wilson modified the sunos section of spkg-install.
