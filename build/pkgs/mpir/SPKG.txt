== Changelog ==

=== mpir-2.1.3.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, November 24th, 2010) ===
 * #8664: Upgrade Sage's MPIR spkg to version 2.1.3
 * Further improvements:
   - Let MPIR select CPU-specific code generation parameters (for CFLAGS) even
     if we (also) pass our own (or user-specified) CC and CFLAGS; these might
     be used by MPFR and GMP-ECM later, too, since MPIR's settings are recorded
     in 'gmp.h' / 'mpir.h'.
     Don't override user-settings (and respect SAGE_FAT_BINARY, SAGE_DEBUG
     etc.) though. Add '-march-native' if appropriate and supported.
  * Recognize also lower-case 'power*' arch (from 'uname -m').
  * Major restructuring / reformatting; more comments and messages added.

=== mpir-2.1.3.p1 (Leif Leonhardy, November 5th, 2010) ===
 * #8664: Upgrade Sage's MPIR spkg to version 2.1.3
 * Fix Darwin assembler errors on PPC by passing the option to allow
   use of extended instruction set to it. (See also #5847.)
 * Enable the build of a static MPIR library, to be e.g. used by ECM.
 * Support additional 'configure' options given by MPIR_EXTRA_OPTS,
   and print messages how we configure.
 * Print various environment variable settings (CC, CFLAGS et al.).
 * Move hint to rerun 'make' on *install* errors to correct place.
 * Further comments added.

=== mpir-2.1.3.p0 (Leif Leonhardy, November 3rd, 2010) ===
 * #8664: Upgrade Sage's MPIR spkg to version 2.1.3
 * Dependencies corrected (might be even more, depending on the configuration).
 * Work around executable stack issue on Fedora 14 (and other SELinux-
   enabled systems).
 * If 'make install' fails, this might be due to a rare race condition;
   give a hint that rerunning 'make' might be sufficient.
 * Support SAGE_DEBUG (disabling optimzation), but add debug symbols by
   default and enable optimization (-O3) if SAGE_DEBUG!="yes".
 * spkg-install clean-up:
   - Use $UNAME instead of `uname`.
   - Support "fat" binaries on Linux i486 and i586 as well,
     give warning if not supported (e.g. ia64 [?]).
   - Remove dead code; more or less cosmetic changes.
 * spkg-check:
   - Use $MAKE instead of 'make'.
   - Print messages on success and error.

=== mpir-2.1.1 (Mike Hansen, August 16th, 2010) ===
 * #8664: Upgrade Sage's MPIR spkg to version 2.1.1

=== mpir-1.2.2.p1 (Georg S. Weber, May 18th 2010) ===
 * Update the License information (e.g. above), as kindly requested
   on the MPIR project homepage (see "http://www.mpir.org/past.html"):
   "... Note MPIR 1.2.2 is overall LGPL v3+ due to us accidentally including
    an LGPL v3 file (mpf/set_str.c). Please distribute this version of the
    library under the terms of this license! ..."
   (According to "http://trac.mpir.org/mpir_trac/ticket/71", this LGPL v3 file
   stems from (patches for) GMP 4.2.4 in the year 2008.)
   Also copied two new files "gpl-3.0.txt" and "lgpl-3.0.txt" under src/, taken
   from the updated mpir-1.2.2 "vanilla" tarball downloaded under the link:
       http://www.mpir.org/mpir-1.2.2.tar.gz
   According to private communication with Bill Hart (MPIR upstream), this
   addition of two files was the only change done to the tarball itself.

=== mpir-1.2.2.p0 (David Kirkby, January 5th 2010) ===
 * 7849. Included two header files so MPIR builds with Sun
  studio if configured with  --enable-cxx and the newer
  Sun C++ library is used (library=stlport4). This is between
  #ifdefine __SUNPRO_CC and #endif, so will have no effect
  except if Sun Studio is used.

=== mpir-1.2.2 (William Stein, Nov 18, 2009) ===
 * Upgraded to MPIR-1.2.2.

=== mpir-1.2.p9 (William Stein, Nov 12, 2009) ===
 * Also enable --enable-fat for i686.

=== mpir-1.2.p8 (William Stein, Nov 10, 2009) ===
 * Put ABI=32 back except on OS X 10.6 (all versions)

=== mpir-1.2.p6 (William Stein, Sept 25, 2009) ===
 * Put ABI=32 back except on OS X 10.6

=== mpir-1.2.p5 (William Stein, Sept 24, 2009) ===
 * Remove explicit ABI=32 for OS X; instead let the OS decide. This is needed for 10.6 where
   the default is 64-bit instead of 32-bit.
