 * #9034 Use the 'makefile.osx64' for any 64-bit system, not just
   OS X, as it is quite generic. This allows flitqs to build
   64-bit on OpenSolaris, and will probably build 64-bit on any half
   reasonable operating system if SAGE64 is set to "yes"
 * Remove the 'dist' subdirectory - see #5903

=== flintqs-20070817.p4 (Michael Abshoff, April 14th, 2008) ===
 * Fix OSX 64 bit build

=== flintqs-20070817.p3 (Michael Abshoff, April 14th, 2008) ===
 * apply gcc 4.3 build patch. This has to go upstream
