== Description ==

Python is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that can be used for many kinds of software development. It offers strong support for integration with other languages and tools, comes with extensive standard libraries, and can be learned in a few days. Many Python programmers report substantial productivity gains and feel the language encourages the development of higher quality, more maintainable code.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * Remove src/Lib/distutils/command/wininst-6.exe and src/Lib/distutils/command/wininst-7.1.exe. Once we support Windows we will likely need to add them back in.
 * We used to block parallel MAKE, but extensive testing [make -j64] showed that there is no longer any problem. Should it rear its ugly head again we will disable it again.
