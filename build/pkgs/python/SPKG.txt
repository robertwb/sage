== Description ==

Python is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that can be
used for many kinds of software development. It offers strong support
for integration with other languages and tools, comes with extensive
standard libraries, and can be learned in a few days. Many Python
programmers report substantial productivity gains and feel the
language encourages the development of higher quality, more
maintainable code.

There are a large number of community resources. For more details see

== Dependencies ==

 * None

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * Remove src/Lib/distutils/command/wininst-*.exe when building a
   new spkg. Once we support Windows we will likely need to add them
   back in.
 * We used to block parallel MAKE, but extensive testing [make -j64]
   showed that there is no longer any problem. The problem was the a
   parallel make install causes trouble.
 * There are two fixes that can be removed once we update to a
   Python newer than 2.6.4: the readline-spacebug.patch below, and
   the 'unset DISTUTILS_DEBUG' in spkg-install.

=== Patches ===

 * cPickle.c.patch, pickle.py.patch: These add support for pickling
   classes with a metaclass via copy_reg. These have been submitted
   upstream: http://bugs.python.org/issue7689
 * locale.py: Work around import failures for locales
 * readline-spacebug.patch: Fix issue where a space is inserted
   after tab completing at the command line. This is merged upstream
   and can be removed as soon as a Python newer than 2.6.4 is used.
 * readline-Itanium-fix.patch: Fix Itanium specific readline
   extension problem.
 * sdist.py.patch: Make sure that sdist copies over the .hg directory.
 * socket.py.patch: Work around an SSL issue.

== Changelog ==


=== python-2.6.4.p7 (David Kirkby, 2nd March, 2010) ===
 #7867 Fixes a Python bug that prevents some python extensions
 being build on Solaris. See http://bugs.python.org/issue1759169
 http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7867
 This is a critical bug fix, as it completely stops a build on
 Solaris 10 (SPARC).

=== python-2.6.4.p6 (Jaap Spies, Feb 23, 2010) ===
 * #7761 Fix build in Open Solaris x64 with SAGE64=yes

=== python-2.6.4.p5 (William Stein, Jan 20, 2010) ===
* Fix bug on Itanium introduced by typo by Craig in #60.  See trac 8020.

=== python-2.6.4.p4 (Craig Citro, Jan 17, 2010) ===
* Move MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET fix to sage-env, so that it's
  used for all python-related spkgs. (This was leading to a
  build issue with numpy and scipy on 10.4.)

=== python-2.6.4.p3 (John Palmieri, David Kirkby Jan 14, 2010) ===
* Add "CC=$CC $CFLAGS" in order to get the code to honor CFLAGS.
  Otherwise, CFLAGS gets ignored. Changes to sage-env will ensure
  CFLAGS gets set to sensible values.
* Do same for CXX and CXXFLAGS
* Remove an undesirable 'set -e' which stopped errors being displayed.

=== python-2.6.4.p2 (Craig Citro, Jan 14, 2010) ===
* Fix OSX 10.6 "Abort trap" issue by setting an appropriate value for
  MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET. See trac #7095 for more details.

* General cleanup of spkg-install, patches/ directory.

=== python-2.6.4.p1 (John Palmieri Jan 11, 2010) ===
* Remove the pkgutil.py patch, since it doesn't seem to be needed any
  more.

=== python-2.6.4.p0 (John Palmieri Jan 11, 2010) ===
* Upgrade to Python 2.6.4.  Remove the ctypes__init__.py patch, since
  it only applies to OS X 10.3 or earlier, and we don't support that.

=== python-2.6.2.p2 (Jason Grout Sep 22, 2009) ===
* Patch for readline-6.0: http://bugs.python.org/issue5833 (we
  applied the small patch
  http://bugs.python.org/file14599/python-2.6-readline.patch)

=== python-2.6.2.p0 (Robert Miller June 25th, 2009) ===
 * Fixed issue with "import _ssl"
 * Help from Martin Albrecht and William Stein

=== python-2.6.2 (Mike Hansen June 19th, 2009) ===
 * Updated to Python 2.6.2.

    had been fixed upstream.

=== python-2.5.4.p0 (Mike Hansen, May 28th, 2009) ===
 * Fixed issue with distutils's sdist command not copying over our .hg
   repository.  This change that caused this was
   http://bugs.python.org/issue1725737.
 * Included a fix by Michael Abshoff: patch posixmodule.c to avoid an
   incorrectly detected out of memory error - see
   http://bugs.python.org/issue1608818

=== python-2.5.4 (Michael Abshoff, February 15th, 2008) ===
 * rebase to latest upstream 2.5.4 release

   black spot!

=== python-2.5.2.p6 (Michael Abshoff, September 14th, 2008) ===
 * disable pymalloc if SAGE_VALGRIND is set to "yes"
