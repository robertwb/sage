== Description ==

Python is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that can be
used for many kinds of software development. It offers strong support
for integration with other languages and tools, comes with extensive
standard libraries, and can be learned in a few days. Many Python
programmers report substantial productivity gains and feel the
language encourages the development of higher quality, more
maintainable code.

very few restrictions on what you can do with Python. Most of the

few files have a different copyright owner, but the same license

== Upstream Contact ==

There are a large number of community resources. For more details see
http://www.python.org/community/

== Dependencies ==

 * GNU patch
 * readline
 * libpng
 * SQLite

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * Remove src/Lib/distutils/command/wininst-*.exe when building a
   new spkg. Once we support Windows we will likely need to add them
   back in.
 * We used to block parallel MAKE, but extensive testing [make -j64]
   showed that there is no longer any problem. The problem is with
   parallel 'make install', which remains disabled.
 * Spaces in SAGE_ROOT aren't yet fully supported by this package,
   since we put $SAGE_LOCAL/... into CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS, which
   wouldn't work then.

=== Patches ===

 * cPickle.c.patch, pickle.py.patch: These add support for pickling
   classes with a metaclass via copy_reg. These have been submitted
   upstream: http://bugs.python.org/issue7689
   This is fixed in python-2.7.3 and can be removed at the next upgrade.
 * sdist.py.patch: Make sure that sdist copies over the .hg directory.
 * socket.py.patch: Work around an SSL issue.
 * Makefile.pre.in.patch: Changes the permission of installed libraries
   to 0755 (like any other library) instead of 0555.

== Changelog ==

=== python-2.7.2.p3 (Jeroen Demeyer, R. Andrew Ohana, 8 February 2012) ===
 * Trac #12430: add -fwrapv to CFLAGS if supported.  This is needed for
   building with clang.
 * Simplify spkg-install
 * Removed redundant CC="$CC $CFLAGS" from ./configure
 * Do not export EXTRAFLAGS.

=== python-2.7.2.p2 (John Palmieri, 3 February 2012) ===
 * Trac #11967: on OS X Lion, delete the file
   $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/config/libpython2.7.a.  Its presence causes
   problems with GiNaC.

=== python-2.7.2.p1 (Jeroen Demeyer, 4 January 2012) ===
 * Trac #9958: delete $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-*/build directories of
   older Python versions to fix upgrading.
 * Remove obsolete patch Modules.Setup.dist.patch
 * Clean up spkg-install, remove old/unused parts.

=== python-2.7.2.p0 (Fran√ßois Bissey, December 21st, 2011) ===
 * #9958 Upgrade to python-2.7.2.
 * Converted the spkg to use patch exclusively.
 * A number of patches have been dropped because the fix are in this release
   or they don't apply cleanly anymore. The list of dropped patches is:
   - locale.py doesn't apply to this release
   - readline-spacebug.patch fixed in this release
   - readline-Itanium-fix.patch cannot be applied as is in this release
   - socketmodule.c fixed in this release
   - setup.py.multiarch.patch fixed in this release

=== python-2.6.4.p13 (Simon King, 10 December 2011) ===
 * #12131: use --libdir, to make the package work on openSUSE.

=== python-2.6.4.p12 (Jeroen Demeyer, 3 December 2011) ===
 * #12096: properly disable parallel make install by using the "-j1"
   option to $MAKE.
 * Install libraries writable, with permission 0755 instead of 0555.

=== python-2.6.4.p11 (Jan Medlock and Leif Leonhardy, July 5th, 2011) ===
 * #11447, #11243: crypt also fails to build on Debian Unstable.  This
   fix is lifted from Python 2.7.  Should be fixed for Debian and
   derivatives, provided the user has the dpkg-dev package installed.
   We now give a hint on that if any import test fails.
 * Minor clean-up; send error messages to stderr.

=== python-2.6.4.p10 (Jan Groenewald and David Kirkby, April 24th 2011) ===
 * #11243 crypt module fails to build on Ubuntu 11.04 See:
   http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/593b9a4124f5075d
 * Simplified the method for checking that Python modules are imported
   OK, which removes the need to repeating code by using a loop.
 * Adds a check that the crypt module imports OK. This is done on every platform -
   not just Ubuntu.

=== python-2.6.4.p9 (Robert Bradsure and David Kirkby, June 21st, 2010) ===
 * #9042 - Cython fails to build on OpenSolaris x64
   This adds the -m64 flag to OPT to build distutils extensions.
   (Robert Bradsure, 25th May 2010)
 * Check that distutils builtin modules work before trying hashlib.
   (Robert Bradsure, 25th May 2010)
 * Ensure the _socket module builds on OpenSolaris x64 (this solves
   #9041 and #9022)
   David Kirkby (30th May 2010)
 * #9295 Add an spkg-check file for Python

=== python-2.6.4.p8 (Mike Hansen, 25th May, 2010) ===
 * Added '--enabled-shared' which is needed on certain platforms
   (Linux and Solaris) for #8542.
 * Added a Makefile.pre.in patch described above.

=== python-2.6.4.p7 (David Kirkby, 5th March, 2010) ===
 * #7867 Fixes a Python bug that prevents some python extensions
 being build on Solaris. See http://bugs.python.org/issue1759169
 http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7867
 This is a critical bug fix, as it completely stops a build on
 Solaris 10 (SPARC).
 * #8440 Set HAVE_FD_TRANSFER=0 in setup.py to allow
   _multiprocessing to build on Solaris.
 * #8356 Remove the option --without-libpng to Python's configure
   script, as that is no longer a valid option.

=== python-2.6.4.p6 (Jaap Spies, Feb 23, 2010) ===
 * #7761 Fix build in Open Solaris x64 with SAGE64=yes

=== python-2.6.4.p5 (William Stein, Jan 20, 2010) ===
* Fix bug on Itanium introduced by typo by Craig in #60.  See trac 8020.

=== python-2.6.4.p4 (Craig Citro, Jan 17, 2010) ===
* Move MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET fix to sage-env, so that it's
  used for all python-related spkgs. (This was leading to a
  build issue with numpy and scipy on 10.4.)

=== python-2.6.4.p3 (John Palmieri, David Kirkby Jan 14, 2010) ===
* Add "CC=$CC $CFLAGS" in order to get the code to honor CFLAGS.
  Otherwise, CFLAGS gets ignored. Changes to sage-env will ensure
  CFLAGS gets set to sensible values.
* Do same for CXX and CXXFLAGS
* Remove an undesirable 'set -e' which stopped errors being displayed.

=== python-2.6.4.p2 (Craig Citro, Jan 14, 2010) ===
* Fix OSX 10.6 "Abort trap" issue by setting an appropriate value for
  MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET. See trac #7095 for more details.

* General cleanup of spkg-install, patches/ directory.

=== python-2.6.4.p1 (John Palmieri Jan 11, 2010) ===
* Remove the pkgutil.py patch, since it doesn't seem to be needed any
  more.

=== python-2.6.4.p0 (John Palmieri Jan 11, 2010) ===
* Upgrade to Python 2.6.4.  Remove the ctypes__init__.py patch, since
  it only applies to OS X 10.3 or earlier, and we don't support that.

=== python-2.6.2.p2 (Jason Grout Sep 22, 2009) ===
* Patch for readline-6.0: http://bugs.python.org/issue5833 (we
  applied the small patch
  http://bugs.python.org/file14599/python-2.6-readline.patch)

    had been fixed upstream.

=== python-2.5.4.p0 (Mike Hansen, May 28th, 2009) ===
 * Fixed issue with distutils's sdist command not copying over our .hg
   repository.  This change that caused this was
   http://bugs.python.org/issue1725737.
 * Included a fix by Michael Abshoff: patch posixmodule.c to avoid an
   incorrectly detected out of memory error - see
   http://bugs.python.org/issue1608818
