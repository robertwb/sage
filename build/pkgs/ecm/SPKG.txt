 * src/ contains upstream code, no patches were applied.
 * GMP-ECM comes with a self-tuning feature; we could support
   that as an option ($SAGE_TUNE_*=yes) in the future.

== Changelog ==

=== ecm-6.3.p0 (Leif Leonhardy, November 4th, 2010) ===
 * #5847: Reviewer patch applied to Mike's spkg (upgrade to 6.3)
 * There are no patches, but to avoid confusion with the previous
   one, it's now 'p0'.
 * Added sanity checks to spkg-install and spkg-check.
 * Add debug symbols by default, disable optimization if SAGE_DEBUG=yes,
   enable optimization (-O3) otherwise.
 * Remove also the manual page of previous installations.
 * Typo: 'rm -r' -> 'rm -f' (header file)
 * Removed setting of CXXFLAGS, since we don't have C++ code.
 * Don't overwrite CFLAGS if SAGE64=yes (instead, append).
   Removed -O2 -g in that case. Make use of CFLAG64 if set.
 * Quote $SAGE_LOCAL in the parameters to configure, too.
 * Use $MAKE instead of 'make' in spkg-check, too.
 * Some messages changed (e.g. all failures now starting with "Error"),
   some added.
 * A few comments/notes added (SPKG.txt, spkg-install).

=== ecm-6.2.1.p1 (François Bissey, October 26th, 2009) ===
 * The removal of the old version of ecm in ecm-6.2.1_p0.spkg is

   "SAGE_LOCAL".
