About

This spkg builds ATLAS for Sage. It is build per default on Linux,
but should also work on OSX and Solaris. The build is currently
disabled on OSX until we sort out some linking issues on OSX.
On FreeBSD dynamic libraries don't won since the wrong flags are
paased to the linker. THis will be fixed soon.

Maintainers: Michael Abshoff, Josh Kantor

ChangeLog

=== atlas-3.8.p9 (Michael Abshoff, Jan. 22nd, 2008) ===
 * fix SAGE_ATLAS_LIB to point to the root of the ATLAS directory
 * also link the headers which is the prime motivation for the change above
 * Apply row-major GEMM major ATLAS errata (#1787)

*20080119: Josh Kantor (3.8.p8)
  + Added optional environment variable SAGE_ATLAS_LIB. This should be a directory that
    contains liblapack.so,libcblas.so, libf77blas.so, libatlas.so. Instead of building
    atlas we make symlinks to these libraries in $SAGE_LOCAL/lib


* 20071215: Josh Kantor (3.8.p6)
  + check if ATLAS bailed out due to unprecise timings. This happens
    if the system is too loaded.

* 20071214: Josh Kantor (3.8.p5)
  + introduce workaround for 32 bit userspace build on 64 bit CPUs -
    see #1497

* 20071213: Michael Abshoff (3.8.p4)
  + disable parallel make

* 20071211 Josh Kantor (3.8.p3)
  + disable build on OSX for now

* 20071128: Josh kantor <jkantor@math.washington.edu>
  + updated to version 3.8
  + applied patch so that shared libraries are copied
  + fortran wrapper uses sage_fortran
  + ATLAS produces borked lapack.so which has missing symbols
  + liblapack.so is around 100k while liblapack.a is 8 mb
  + I manually create a full liblapack.so

* 20071006: Michael Abshoff <mashoff@fsmath.mathematik.uni-dortmund.de>
 + update to 3.7.38

* 20070815: Michael Abshoff <mashoff@fsmath.mathematik.uni-dortmund.de>
 + new upstream release (3.7.37), initial release
 + "make check" added in spkg-check
