= ATLAS =

== Description ==

This spkg builds ATLAS for Sage. It is build per default on Linux, but should
also work on OSX and Solaris.

== License ==

3-clause BSD

== SPKG Maintainers ==
 * David Kirkby
 * William Stein

== Upstream Contact ==

 * Atlas devel mailing list.

 * Clint Whaley has frequently answered questions from the Sage project

== Dependencies ==

 * Fortran
 * Python
 * Lapack

== Build Instructions/Notes ==

 * patches/archinfo_linux.c.patch: Fix Itanium2 support on modern
   RHEL 5 and SLES 10 systems
 * patches/archinfo_x86.c.patch: add cpuid support for Pentium D, E models
 * patches/Make.top.patch: add make install target for shared libs
 * patches/probe_comp.c.patch: work around -m64 issue on Itanium2
 * Tuning info for K732SSE1.tgz, PM32SSE2.tgz and PPCG432.tgz
 * Changes linker flags on Solaris if the Sun linker is used.
 * AN UPDATE TO THE LATEST ATLAS IS WELL OVERDUE, BUT THIS IS NON-TRIVIAL
 * Changing this package, which takes a long time to build, so it (and the
   Fortran package) did not use Python, would allow the ATLAS build to be
   started sooner in parallel builds. This should reduce the overall time to
   build Sage.
 * The package is never installed on Cygwin or OS X.
 * The code which calls 'readelf' can almost certainly be removed.

The package can be configured via two environment variables:

 * SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=path
   If this environment variable is set, path/libatlas.so is used
   and ATLAS is not compiled.

 * SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=arch[,isaext1][,isaext2]...[,isaextN]
   The given architectural default and instruction set extensions are
   used instead of the empirical tuning. Available architectures are

     POWER3, POWER4, POWER5, PPCG4, PPCG5, P5, P5MMX, PPRO, PII, PIII,
     PM, CoreSolo, CoreDuo, Core2Solo, Core2, Corei7, P4, P4E,
     Efficeon, K7, HAMMER, AMD64K10h, UNKNOWNx86, IA64Itan, IA64Itan2,
     USI, USII, USIII, USIV, UnknownUS, MIPSR1xK, MIPSICE9

   and instruction set extensions are

     AltiVec, SSE3, SSE2, SSE1, 3DNow

   In addition, you can also set

    - SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast picks defaults for a modern (2-3 year old)
      CPU of your processor line, and

    - SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base picks defaults that should work for a ~10
      year old CPU.

   For example,

     SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=Corei7,SSE3,SSE2,SSE1

   would be appropriate for a Core i7 CPU.

== TODO ==

 * The build is currently disabled on OSX until we sort out some
   linking issues on OSX.

 * On FreeBSD dynamic libraries don't work since the wrong flags are
   passed to the linker. This will be fixed soon.

== ChangeLog ==

== atlas-3.8.3.p17 (Volker Braun, November 5th 2010) ==
 * Rewrite the spkg-install script in pure python. Introduce the
   SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH environment variable.

== atlas-3.8.3.p16 (John Palmieri, September 19th 2010) ==
 * Make spkg-check work when using SAGE_ATLAS_LIB: if SAGE_ATLAS_LIB
   is set, skip the self-tests.

== atlas-3.8.3.p15 (David Kirkby, September 6th 2010) ==
 * Make SAGE_ATLAS_LIB use static libraries on all platforms,
   as building two shared libraries often fails on Linux, and
   messes things up on Solaris. The static library is less hassle
   all around. Worth noting is that the ATLAS package only builds
   the static library and Wolfram Research only ship the static
   library with Mathematica, despite they usually use shared
   libraries. To ensure full compatibility with a fresh build
   of ATLAS, the symbolic links are created for the shared libraries too.
   The links will fail to be created if the shared libraries do not exist,
   but will not cause any extra problems.
 * Update the list of dependencies to include Python and Lapack (see
   spkg/deps)
 * Note that the ATLAS build process could be made much quicker if its
   depenancy on Python was removed. Since the amount of Python code is
   very small compared to the bash code, this seems logical to do at
   a later date. The Fortran package would need the same change - but again
   the amount of Python in that is trivial.
 * Add a note that make-correct-shared.sh is badly named, as it often fails.
 * Remove the OS X specific code from make-correct-shared.sh, as ATLAS is
   never installed on OS X - see the spkg-install-script.

== atlas-3.8.3.p14 (David Kirkby, August 10th 2010) ==
 * #9508 Fix multiple ATLAS build issues on Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris.
 * Remove an inaccurate comment from spkg-install-script
   about the number of shred libraries built.
 * Build shared libraries libatlas.so libf77blas.so libcblas.so
   on Solaris properly using the Sun linker. The library
   liblapack.so is NOT built as it causes problems with R.
 * Delete liblapack.so in make_correct_shared.sh on Solaris just
   in case it is built by ATLAS, which does build some
   libraries. (This is probably an unnecessary step, but
   it's better to be safe than sorry).
 * Correct linker options on 32-bit Solaris 10 or 32-bit
   OpenSolaris builds on x86. These may not be optimal, but at
   least they allow ATLAS to build.
 * Make SPKG.txt have lines with less than 80 characters
 * Fix a couple of spelling errors.
 * Report whether the tests pass or fail in spkg-check.
 * Report whether the timing data is collected correctly in spkg-check

=== atlas-3.8.3.p13 (John Palmieri, June 27th, 2010) ===
 * #9356. Fix system_alias.py so that it works properly with Solaris:
   when we build ATLAS on Solaris, we do not install liblapack.so --
   see make_correct_shared.sh.  So we shouldn't test for its
   existence when using SAGE_ATLAS_LIB, either.

=== atlas-3.8.3.p12 (Jaap Spies, Februari 22th 2010) ===
 * #8039 For use with the Sun ld with SAGE64="yes" change ldflag
   -melf_86_64 to -64
 * See also the remarks from David Kirkby on atlas-3.8.3.p5

=== atlas-3.8.3.p11 (Peter Jeremy, 2010-01-25)===
 * #7827: Fix atlas-3.8.3.p9 compilation on FreeBSD
 * Minh Van Nguyen: patch spkg-install-script to copy
   patches/SpewMakeInc.c over to src/CONFIG/src/SpewMakeInc.c

=== atlas-3.8.3.p10 (David Kirkby, January 5th 2010) ===
 * replace bitwidth.py which uses 'ctypes' at that is broken
   on many platforms.

=== atlas-3.8.3.p7 (William Stein, Sept 21 2009) ===
 * Make this into a dummy package on Cygwin that requires lapack.

=== atlas-3.8.3.p6 (David Kirkby, July 19th 2009) ===
 * Trac #6558
   This is an enhancement to trac #6276, which applies a Solaris patch
   to only those based on the sun4v architecture, rather than all Solaris
   machines.
 * Finished off an unfinished sentance in a comment in spkg-install

=== atlas-3.8.3.p5 (David Kirkby, June 24th 2009) ===
 * Made a backup of ATLAS-build/lib/Makefile to ATLAS-build/lib/Makefile.orig
 * Alter the flags in ATLAS-build/lib/Makefile with those that will work if
   the linker used is the Sun linker. The default Makefile makes use of the
   GNU linker's flags, such as "-shared" which is not acceptable to the Sun
   linker.

   The patch is only applied if the operating system is Solaris, and the
   linker is not the GNU linker. The flags charged are:
   -shared ==> -G
   -soname ==> -h
   --whole-archive ==>  -z allextract
   --no-whole-archive ==> -z defaultextract

    NOTES:
    1) Sun have a tool which accepts gcc flags, but calls the Sun compiler.
    This patch might mess things up if that is used. Having never used the tool
    it's impossible to be 100% sure of this. Anyway, that will be some time in
    the future, so this patch can be removed.

    2) The fact the linker flags are GNU specific has been reported to the ATLAS
    maintainer, so they may fix this problem. In which case the patch could be
    removed at a later date.
  * Fixed a minor spelling mistake in this file

=== atlas-3.8.3.p4 (David Kirkby, June 16th 2009) ===
 * Change GuessSmallNB() in src/tune/blas/gemm/mmsearch.c
   as suggested by Clint Whaley to return 28
   on Solaris. This is ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX and once the real problem
   in the function is sorted out, this fix will need to be removed. But
   for now it permits ATLAS to build on a Sun T5240 with gcc-4.4.0.
