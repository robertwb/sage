== Description ==

Cephes Mathematical Library. Latest Linux distribution, dated
6/4/00. Special functions and other goodies in C, including long
double precision routines for 68K, 386, and sparc processors. This is

not the most up-to-date one). It includes these sections-- double: all
functions in 64-bit double precision; single: all available functions
in 32-bit single precision; long double: all available functions in
80-bit extended precision; 128bit: all available functions in 128-bit
long double precision; qlib: all functions in q-type extended (44 to
106 decimal) precision, includes a C++ class for the binary floating
point arithmetic and a q-type calculator program; c9x-complex: new C
language standard C9X data type for complex variables, header
complex.h for GNU C and functions in float complex, double complex,
and long double complex precisions.
