== Description ==

John Cremona's programs for enumerating and computating with elliptic
curves defined over the rational numbers. This is the culmination of
over 25 years of hard work.

=== Special Update/Build Instructions ===

 * The makefiles do use GNU extensions. This causes build failures on systems like FreeBSD where GNU's make is usually called gmake. A workaround is to create a symlink from gmake to make in {{{~/bin}}} and to add that directory to {{{$PATH}}} before the directory that contains the BSD make

== Changelog ==

=== eclib-20120115.p0 (John Cremona, 18 January 2012) ===

   ldconfig) as suggested on review at trac #10993

=== eclib-20120115 (John Cremona, 15 January 2012) ===
 * Source code now at http://code.google.com/p/eclib/
 * Current source code is revision 2b04700f06ba (as at 15 January 2012)

=== eclib-20100711.p0 (Mariah Lenox and Leif Leonhardy, September 28th 2011) ===
 * #11354: Deleted the obsolete (Debian) dist/ directory. (May 2011)
 * Comment by Leif:
   Since (as release manager) I had to add this changelog entry, which was
   missing, and fix the files' permissions anyway, I also did little "off-ticket"
   clean-up (kind of "reviewer patch"):
   - Use `cp -p` in all copy commands, since the current umask might break
     permissions again.
   - Check exit codes of `cp` (and `strip`) and all other important commands.
   - Minor cosmetic clean-up, such as replacing `uname` by "$UNAME" and  else-if
     ladders by `elif`.

=== eclib-20100711 (John Cremona, 11 July 2010) ===
