== Description ==

John Cremona's programs for enumerating and computating with elliptic
curves defined over the rational numbers. This is the culmination of
over 25 years of hard work.

=== Special Update/Build Instructions ===

 * The makefiles do use GNU extensions. This causes build failures on systems like FreeBSD where GNU's make is usually called gmake. A workaround is to create a symlink from gmake to make in {{{~/bin}}} and to add that directory to {{{$PATH}}} before the directory that contains the BSD make
