== Description ==

'patch' takes a patch file containing a difference listing produced
by the 'diff' program and applies those differences to one
or more original files, producing patched versions.

The version of 'patch' included is the GNU one. Some of the 'diff' files
produced by GNU 'diff' are not acceptble to some versions of the 'patch'
command, such as the 'patch' command that comes with Solaris.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

In the event patches ever need to be made to this package,
the method of applying the patches should not reply on the
'patch' existing on the system.

Some of the self-tests require the GNU version of 'diff' so will
be bypassed on Solaris and OpenSolaris unless the GNU version of
'diff' is the first version of 'diff' in the path. This does not
cause any problems, as the tests detect the Sun diff is not
the GNU diff, so do not run the tests.
