== Changelog ==

=== cliquer-1.2.p11 (John Palmieri, 23 March 2012) ===
 * #12311: Remove explicit path to testcc.sh in spkg-install.

=== cliquer-1.2.p10 (Karl-Dieter Crisman, 28 June 2011) ===
 * #11547: Make sure that libcliquer.so is copied as both
   .dll and .so files on Cygwin

=== cliquer-1.2.p9 (Jeroen Demeyer, 4 May 2011) ===
 * #11227: Apply workaround also for versions 4.6.1 of gcc, not only
   version 4.6.0.  This is to support pre-release versions of
   gcc 4.6.1, the bug should be fixed in the final gcc 4.6.1.

=== cliquer-1.2.p8 (Jeroen Demeyer, 25 April 2011) ===
 * #11227: When compiling with gcc 4.6.0, add compiler flag -fno-ivopts
   to work around a gcc bug.
 * Use `patch` for patching the Makefile and put patches/Makefile.patch
   under hg control.
 * Some minor cleanup of spkg-install and Makefile.

=== cliquer-1.2.p7 David Kirkby, Leif Leonhardy  (14 September 2010) ===
 * #9871 Change flags passed to the linker on Solaris to avoid problems with the
   link-editor believing the shared library contains text relocations. This
   problem can be seen on 32-bit builds of Solaris and OpenSolaris using
   /usr/bin/elfdump, but the problems are much more serious on 64-bit
   builds of Solaris - in some cases stopping code from building.
 * Added the linker flag -ztext on Solaris too, as -ztest forces a fatal
   error if any  relocations   against   non-writable,  allocatable  sections
   remain. This will make it easier to catch any similar bugs in future.

=== cliquer-1.2.p6 Nathann Cohen, David Kirkby (31 August 2010) ===
 * #9766: Additions to SPKG.txt
      - URL of the original website to the SPKG.txt file
      - "Special Update/Build Instructions" section
      - "Dependencies" section
 * Added an entry to SPKG showing when this package was first put into
   Sage. The first mercurial log is dated 17th July 2009.
 * Added a note on to the cliquer-1.2.p0 entry in SPKG.txt that 'scons'
   was no longer used.

=== cliquer-1.2.p5 Mike Hansen (15 February 2010) ===
 * Fixed Trac #8279 to make the cliquer spkg work on Cygwin with the Sage library.

=== cliquer-1.2.p4 Mike Hansen, William Stein (12 February 2010) ===
 * Fixed Trac #7308 to make the cliquer spkg work on Cygwin.
