Package: libflint-1.06
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: C library for number theory, shared library
 This library is designed to provide funtionality similar
 to that of NTL with an emphasis on speed in small cases
 as well as asymptotically.
 .
 Currently supports polynomial arithmetic over the integers,
 fast integer arithmetic and factoring (including a highly
 optimized quadratic seive.
