Priority: extra
Maintainer: Tim Abbott <tabbott@mit.edu>
Build-Depends: cdbs (>= 0.4.23-1.1), debhelper (>= 5), quilt, patchutils (>= 0.2.25), cdbs (>= 0.4.27-1), libgmp3-dev, libqd-dev
Standards-Version: 3.7.2

Package: libflint0
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: C library for number theory
 This library is designed to provide funtionality similar
 to that of NTL with an emphasis on speed in small cases
 as well as asymptotically.
 .
 Currently supports polynomial arithmetic over the integers,
 fast integer arithmetic and factoring (including a highly
 optimized quadratic seive.
 .
 This version of flint modified for SAGE.
