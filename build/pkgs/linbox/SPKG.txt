* 2007-09-03: merged LinBox ChangeSet 2803, which fixes #498 without the

             (mabshoff)


1. Modified charpoly.h and commentator.C

2. Added linboxwrap (malb)

3. Change the line in configure so tuning doesn't take like 30 minutes
   and crash the host computer!

       size_t n=300, nmax=2000, prec=512, nbest=0, count=0;

4. Change a line in linbox/Makefile.in so we don't build interfaces
   (which requires Maple, etc., -- way too many requirements).
