*2007-10-29: (mabshoff)

  * added fix for #1026
  * add "-g" to CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS for better valgrind output
  * add .hgignore
  * add all under patches and linbox_wrap to hg repo

*2007-09-03: merged LinBox ChangeSet 2803, which fixes #498 without the
             performance regression of the initial workaround
             (mabshoff)


1. Modified charpoly.h and commentator.C

2. Added linboxwrap (malb)

3. Change the line in configure so tuning doesn't take like 30 minutes
   and crash the host computer!

       size_t n=300, nmax=2000, prec=512, nbest=0, count=0;

4. Change a line in linbox/Makefile.in so we don't build interfaces
   (which requires Maple, etc., -- way too many requirements).
