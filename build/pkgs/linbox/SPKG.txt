1. Modified charpoly.h and commentator.C

2. Added linboxwrap (malb)

3. Change the line in configure so tuning doesn't take like 30 minutes
   and crash the host computer!

       size_t n=300, nmax=2000, prec=512, nbest=0, count=0;

4. Change a line in linbox/interfaces/Makefile.in that required maple headers
   no matter what.
