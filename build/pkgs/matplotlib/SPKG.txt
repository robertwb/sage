== Description ==

From the Matplotlib website: matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell (ala matlab or mathematica), web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits.

== Build Instructions/Changes ==

The following patches are in the patches subdirectory.
The patches are applied in during the build process.

* setupext.py: link to libpng12 instead of libpng to apparently avoid
  some name clashes on OSX.
* WrapPython.h: delete unnecessary kludges to compile on Solaris

== Changelog ==

=== matplotlib 1.0.0 (Jason Grout, 16 Sep 2010) ===
 * Update to matplotlib 1.0.0.

=== matplotlib-0.99.3-svn8415 (Jason Grout, 11 Jun 2010) ===
 * Update to SVN revision 8415 (which is 0.99.3 + some bugfixes we
   would like).  Removed pprdrv_tt2.cpp patch (no longer needed) and
   incorporated the functionality of the setupext.py and setup.py
   patches into the make-setup-config.py script, which uses the
   matplotlib-supported way to effect the changes.  The only other
   patch was to change libpng to libpng12; this patch was left as the
   patch for setupext.py.

=== matplotlib-0.99.1.p4 (Craig Citro, 14 Jan 2010) ===
 * Removed hideous hack, now that OSX 10.6 bug is fixed.

=== matplotlib-0.99.1.p2 (William Stein, 6 Jan 2010) ===
 * Re-implemented hideous temporary hack (trac 7865).

=== matplotlib-0.99.1.p2 (William Stein, 29 Sep 2009) ===
 * Implemented hideous temporary hack to get around issue with pyCXX crashing on OS X 10.6

=== matplotlib-0.99.1 (Jason Grout, 22 Sep 2009) ===
 * Update to matplotlib 0.99.1.  Several of our patches were incorporated upstream, so deleted those and updated the others.

=== matplotlib-0.99.0 (Jason Grout, August 9th, 2009) ===
 * Update to matplotlib 0.99.0

=== matplotlib-0.98.5.3rc0-svn6910.p3 (Michael Abshoff, February 20th, 2009) ===
 * Turn off GUI backend unconditionally since they cause trouble on systems without X, ie. sage.math, too. This might be a bug in Matplotlib, but until this is resolved it stays off.

=== matplotlib-0.98.5.3rc0-svn6910.p2 (William Stein, February 20th, 2009) ===
 * Don't build GUI backends on OS X by default.  See trac #5301. This is really a problem with libpng, so this is temporary.

=== matplotlib-0.98.5.3rc0-svn6910.p1 (Jason Grout, February 14, 2009) ===
 * Add a patch for patches.py, which ignores the errors generated when trying to draw arrows that are "too short".

=== matplotlib-0.98.5.3rc0-svn6910.p0 (Michael Abshoff, February 14, 2009) ===
 * link against libpng12 instead of libpng (#4774)
 * disable tkagg on all machines since it causes too much trouble

=== matplotlib-0.98.5.3rc0-svn6910 (Jason Grout, February 13, 2009) ===
 * Update to the latest SVN version (6910) of Matplotlib and update patches.  Two patches disappear because one patch was just updating quiver.py to a mid-release version and arrow_line.py is now subsumed by much nicer functionality in Matplotlib.
 * removed the two images src/doc/_static/eeg* and src/doc/pyplots/(plotmap.png|tex_demo.pdf|plotmap.hires.png|plotmap.pdf) to save space

=== matplotlib-0.98.3.p5 (Michael Abshoff, January 19th, 2009) ===
 * Work around Solaris 10 with gcc 4.3.2 problem in ttconv/pprdrv_tt2.cpp (#5008)

=== matplotlib-0.98.3.p4 (Michael Abshoff, December 12th, 2008) ===
 * apply Craig Citro's OSX build fix (#4680)

=== matplotlib-0.98.3.p3 (William Stein, 25 Nov 2008) ===
 * fix so matplotlib may build in a fallback case (there is a stupid bug in upstreams setupext.py)

== matplotlib-0.98.3.p2 (Jason Grout, 20 Sep 2008) ===
 * Update quiver.py to the SVN version 6115 to make the vector field plots respect aspect ratio.

== matplotlib-0.98.3.p1 (Jason Grout, 03 Sep 2008) ===
 * Add an arrow_line.py file as a patch for "nice" arrows in matplotlib

=== matplotlib-0.98.3.p0 (Michael Abshoff, August 27th, 2008) ===
