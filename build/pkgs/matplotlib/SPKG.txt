== Description ==

From the Matplotlib website: matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell (ala matlab or mathematica), web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits.

== Build Instructions/Changes ==

The following is in the patches subdirectory.  It is copied in during the build process.

Replace setupext.py by a version that adds some SAGE-specific paths so the build doesn't fail (since SAGE includes certain libs that matplotlib depends on).

== Changelog ==

=== matplotlib-0.98.5.3rc0-svn6910.p2 (William Stein, February 20, 2009) ===
 * Don't build GUI backends on OS X by default.  See trac #5301.
   This is really a problem with libpng, so this is temporary.

=== matplotlib-0.98.5.3rc0-svn6910.p1 (Jason Grout, February 14, 2009) ===
 * Add a patch for patches.py, which ignores the errors generated when trying to draw arrows that are "too short".

=== matplotlib-0.98.5.3rc0-svn6910.p0 (Michael Abshoff, February 14, 2009) ===
 * link against libpng12 instead of libpng (#4774)
 * disable tkagg on all machines since it causes too much trouble

=== matplotlib-0.98.5.3rc0-svn6910 (Jason Grout, February 13, 2009) ===
 * Update to the latest SVN version (6910) of Matplotlib and update patches.  Two patches disappear because one patch was just updating quiver.py to a mid-release version and arrow_line.py is now subsumed by much nicer functionality in Matplotlib.
 * removed the two images src/doc/_static/eeg* and src/doc/pyplots/(plotmap.png|tex_demo.pdf|plotmap.hires.png|plotmap.pdf) to save space

=== matplotlib-0.98.3.p5 (Michael Abshoff, January 19th, 2009) ===
 * Work around Solaris 10 with gcc 4.3.2 problem in ttconv/pprdrv_tt2.cpp (#5008)

=== matplotlib-0.98.3.p4 (Michael Abshoff, December 12th, 2008) ===
 * apply Craig Citro's OSX build fix (#4680)

=== matplotlib-0.98.3.p3 (William Stein, 25 Nov 2008) ===
 * fix so matplotlib may build in a fallback case (there is a stupid bug in upstreams setupext.py)

== matplotlib-0.98.3.p2 (Jason Grout, 20 Sep 2008) ===
 * Update quiver.py to the SVN version 6115 to make the vector field plots respect aspect ratio.

== matplotlib-0.98.3.p1 (Jason Grout, 03 Sep 2008) ===
 * Add an arrow_line.py file as a patch for "nice" arrows in matplotlib

 * Merge Ondrej Certik's fix from #3792

=== matplotlib-0.98.3 (Jason Grout, 20 Aug 2008) ===
 * updated to 0.98.3.  Deleted gcc 4.3 fix since it is merged in.

=== matplotlib-0.91.1.p5 (Michael Abshoff, May 18th, 2008) ===
 * add 64 bit OSX build support

=== matplotlib-0.91.1.p4 (Michael Abshoff, April 14th, 2008) ===
