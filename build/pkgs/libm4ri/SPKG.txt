   + switched to LQUP instead of PLUQ for better performance
   + because of this and other improvements much better handling of sparse-ish matrices
   + overall better performance for elimination
   + better performance for mzd_transpose
   + dropped the check for the numer of CPUs from configure which was unused and not cross platform
