== Description ==

The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds powerful image processing and
graphics capabilities to Python.  The library supports many file
formats.

Author: Pythonware <http://www.pythonware.com>

== Dependencies ==

 * Python
 * GNU patch (to apply Sage's patches to upstream source)
 * Optional dependencies on libjpeg>=7, libtiff>=3.9.1, libpng>=1.2.*
   (These have to be copied to SAGE_LOCAL if SAGE_BINARY_BUILD=yes.)
 * Optional dependency (unless SAGE_PIL_NOTK=yes): Tkinter (Tcl/Tk)

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * Make sure the patch(es) still apply, i.e. rebase them if necessary.

== Patches ==

 * dont-add-system-libs-if-binary-build.patch (patch to 'setup.py';
   cf. #9864 and previous tickets):
   - Disable Tkinter support if SAGE_PIL_NOTK="yes".
   - Only look for optional libraries in SAGE_LOCAL if SAGE_BINARY_BUILD
     is "yes".
   - Don't add "/usr/local/lib" twice (cf. #9864), especially make sure
     SAGE_LOCAL[/lib] is searched *first*, before the system lib dirs.

 * search-lib64-dirs-if-appropriate.patch (patch to 'setup.py', based
   on the first one!; cf. #10359):
   - Check if we're on a 64-bit system, and if so, if the '.../lib64'
     directories differ from the '.../lib' ones. In that case, add the
     former, since these contain the proper 64-bit libraries.
     (On Debian-like 64-bit systems in contrast, e.g. '/usr/lib64' is
     just a symbolic link to '/usr/lib', so add the latter there.)

== Changelog ==

=== pil-1.1.6.p4 (Leif Leonhardy, December 1st, 2010) ===
 * #10359: Look for optional (system) libraries in '.../lib64' if appro-
   priate. (On e.g. 64-bit Fedora, CentOS and openSUSE, the directory
   '/usr/lib64' is *not* a symbolic link to '/usr/lib'.)

=== pil-1.1.6.p3 (Leif Leonhardy, Mitesh Patel, December 1st, 2010) ===
 * #9864: Make SAGE_LOCAL/lib precede /usr/local/lib in the library
   search path.
 * Use GNU patch, which is now part of the Sage distribution, to apply the
   patch (rather than copying a pre-patched 'setup.py' file).
 * Revert src/ to vanilla upstream.

=== pil-1.1.6.p2 (Tim Dumol, October 29, 2009) ===
 * Made the dependencies optional.
 * Enabled Tcl/Tk support by default.
 * Added SAGE_BINARY_BUILD and SAGE_PIL_NOTK environment variables:
   - SAGE_BINARY_BUILD -- if "yes", forces libjpeg, libtiff and libpng
     to come from SAGE_LOCAL. (Disabled if not found there.)
   - SAGE_PIL_NOTK -- if set to "yes", disables Tcl/Tk (Tkinter) support.

=== pil-1.1.6.p1 (Tim Dumol, October 29, 2009) ===
 * Changed SPKG and spkg-install to depend on libjpeg, libtiff and
   libpng. Disabled Tcl/Tk (Python's Tkinter) support.

=== pil-1.1.6 (William Stein, November, 2008) ===
 * initial version, straight from website with no changes
