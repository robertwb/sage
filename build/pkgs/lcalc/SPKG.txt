=== lcalc-20070105 ===
 * modified Lcommandline_elliptic.cc to work with Cygwin
  by defining a certain macro.   *** carry this change over when
  updating the package *** and of course backport it upstream.

* New version from Mike R. on 2006-12-05.

* I replaced the included Makefile with my own, since I'm only interested
  in building lcalc and not the library.  Also, since I'm not doing
  development on lcalc, the dependencies aren't needed in order
  to minimize build time.


* 2006-09-15: Fix to spkg-install suggested by Kate Minola:
In lcalc-2006.03.05/spkg-install there is
: CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -O2 -g -Wa,-W -fno-exceptions -Wno-deprecated"
:
: cd src
:
: echo "Building Rubinstein's lcalc program using $CXX..."
:
: make lcalc
but since the environment variable CFLAGS is never exported, the subshell
entered with 'make lcalc' does not pick up the new CFLAGS.  You need to
add
  export CFLAGS
after the new definition of CLAGS.

* Kate Minola:
  Added -static-libgcc
