== Description ==
 * website: http://www.r-project.org/
 * From the "Introdution to R" from the above website: R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

== SPKG Maintainers ==

 * Jason Grout
 * William Stein

== Upstream Contact ==
 * R mailing list, #R in IRC

== Dependencies ==
 * ATLAS

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==
 * TODO: Remove the contained Rpy spkg and ship (and maintain)
   it separately, for many reasons. (#9906 addresses this.)
 * TODO: Clean up spkg-install.

== Changelog ==

=== r-2.14.0.p2 (John H. Palmieri, 17 Dec 2011) ===
 * #12172: unconditionally disable X11 support on Darwin

=== r-2.14.0.p1 (Simon King, 10 Dec 2011) ===
 * #12131: use --libdir, to make the package work on openSUSE

=== r-2.14.0.p0 (Volker Braun, 19th November 2011) ===
 * #12057: upgrade to new upstream version

=== r-2.10.1.p4 (Leif Leonhardy, September 25th 2010) ===
 * #10016: Don't call "sage -f" on the included Rpy spkg, instead call
   "sage-spkg -f" directly, since only this is guaranteed to be present.
   This is just a temporary solution, until the Rpy spkg is removed
   from this one.

=== r-2.10.1.p3 (Mariah Lenox, 30 Jun 2010) ===
 * added "--with-ICU=no" to configure line of spkg-install (#9396)

=== r-2.10.1.p2 (Mitesh Patel, June 8th 2010) ===
 * #9186: Set an empty MAKEFLAGS variable before "make install".  On
   OS X, at least, this fixes building multiple spkgs in parallel (cf.
   #8306).

=== r-2.10.1.p1 (Karl-Dieter Crisman, April 12th 2010) ===
 * Re-enable Aqua support on OSX

=== r-2.10.1.p0 (David Kirkby, February 16th 2010) ===
 * Several items all covered by #8285
 * Added the undocumented option "--without-ICU" on Solaris,
   as that allows R to build - otherwise it fails. I suspect the
   ideal solution would be to add the ICU library from
   http://site.icu-project.org/
   but this option does allow R to build.
 * Ensure SAGE64 will add the -m64 option on any platform,
   not just OS X as before.
 * Removed all references to the option --with-iconv=no,
   as R needs iconv now - it is no longer optional - see
   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/8191
 * Implement a test for X on Solaris, as the previous test in
   spkg-install would always fail on Solaris, as Solaris
   lacks the header file checked for, despite the fact X
   support works fine. So now I check for a library on Solaris.
