== Description ==
 * website: http://www.r-project.org/
 * From the "Introdution to R" from the above website: R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

== Upstream Contact ==
 * R mailing list, #R in IRC

== Dependencies ==
 * ATLAS

== Build Notes ==
 * in r-2.6.1.p12 we removed the recommneded tar.gzs. If we want to build those we need to add them back in. Until then it is better to save the 3MB compressed.
