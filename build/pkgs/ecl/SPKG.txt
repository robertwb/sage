= ECL  =

== Description ==

ECL is an implementation of the Common Lisp language as defined by the
ANSI X3J13 specification. The most relevant features:

 * A bytecodes compiler and interpreter.
 * Compiles Lisp also with any C/C++ compiler.
 * It can build standalone executables and libraries.
 * ASDF, Sockets, Gray streams, MOP, and other useful components.
 * Extremely portable.
 * A reasonable license.

ECL supports the operating systems Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
Solaris and Windows, running on top of the Intel, Sparc, Alpha and
PowerPC processors. Porting to other architectures should be rather
easy.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==
 * Delete the contents of the src/msvc directory
 * Delete the contents of the src/contrib/encodings/
 * TODO - Add the ECL test suite, and an spkg-check file to run it.
 * Note, the way we configure Sage, CXX and CXXFLAGS are unused.
 * Do NOT quote SAGE_LOCAL when setting CPPFLAGS and/or LDFLAGS,
   in spkg-install as this caused the build to break. See

== Changelog ==

=== ecl-11.1.1.p1 (Dmitrii Pasechnik, 6th May 2011) ===
  * altivec must be disabled for ECL on PPC OSX 10.5
    (hopefully ECL people will fix it, then it can be removed)

=== ecl-11.1.1.p0 (Francois Bissey, 23rd March 2011) ===
  * #10986 on some configuration (debian and gentoo are case in point)
    etags can be linked to exuberant-ctags. ecl building system automatically
    detects etags and if etags is actually ctags the build will break.
    We circumvent the building of TAGS so this doesn't happen.

=== ecl-11.1.1 (Fran√ßois Bissey, 13th February 2011) ===
  * #10766 Update to the latest stable release of ECL which will
    solve some long standing problems on 64-bit solaris.
  * Added a patch (ecls-11.1.1-cmploc.lisp.patch) cherrypicked from
    an upstream commit. The problem caused are discussed here:
    http://www.mail-archive.com/ecls-list@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00671.html
    and the commit used to create the patch is here:
    http://ecls.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=ecls/ecl;a=commit;h=ce19c67a1b9f63cd232e7c0a621b6ca87aaa7214

=== ecl-10.4.1 (David Kirkby, 11th November 2010) ===
  * #10187 Update to the latest stable release of ECL, which is needed
    to build on Fedora 14 (see #10185).
  * Added the word "Error" in front of all error messages.
  * Added a TODO to add an spkg-check file. Doing this is not
    trivial. The ECL developer has said the test code on the
    ECL site is outdated, and ECL is not really designed to
    run the test suite after building. We might need to
    address this later.
  * Removed an extra semi-colon on the line:
    echo "SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting";
    That line, with the extra semi-colon is in half the Sage packages.
    Gradually they are getting removed.
  * Used a more portable test for SAGE_LOCAL.
  * Replaced 'make' by '$MAKE' but set MAKE to be "$MAKE -j1" so
    ECL builds serially, and not in parallel.
  * Removed any code in spkg-install related to Fortran. There is only one
    Fortran file in ECL, and that's only used on a Cray. Nobody is
    making any attempt to port Sage to a Cray, and I doubt they will
    either. Removal of the Fortran related variables aids clarity.
  * Removed checks for Sun/GNU compilers, as the prereq script does all this.
  * Likewise remove checks that SAGE_FORTRAN and SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB are
    set, as the prereq script does this.
  * Removed code from spkg-install which deleted temporary files, as the bug
    that required this, has been fixed in the ECL source code. This was
    originally bug #8951 but was actually fixed in #9474.
  * Removed the 'patches' directory as there are no patches!
  * Note, I've left the gmp source code in place, as removing it requires that
    a hacked configure script be produced. This is dangerous, as someone
    is bound to at some point not do that step properly. For a couple of MB, it
    it worth leaving the src unmodified, except for the msvc code. If someone
    forgets to remove the msvc code it will causes no problems. If someone
    fails to update the configure script properly, it will cause havoc.
  * Added variable CFLAG64 and CXXFLAG64 to be consistent with other
    packages, which will permit Sage to build 64-bit even if the right
    compiler flag is not -m64.
  * Removed the patch to dpp.c (bug #9917) as that has been fixed in the
    upstream source code.
  * Changed code to set optimisation flag -O0 if SAGE_DEBUG=yes. This
    is more consistent with other packages.
  * Removed set -e / set +e. When used properly, these are useful, but it
    is very easy for someoone to fail to set them properly, so it's safer
    to not use them.
  * Made notes in this file and spkg-install that the way ECL is configured
    in Sage, the values of CXX and CXXFLAGS are ignored.
  * Removed an inaccurate comment about what MAKE="$MAKE -j1" does.
  * Noted that a certain bit of code would be executed on Solaris Express too,
    rather than just the Solaris and OpenSolaris that were listed before.
  * Ensured that user-defined values for CFLAGS & CXXFLAGS do not get
    overridden, as they would have been when SAGE_DEBUG was not "yes"


=== ecl-10.2.1.p3 (David Kirkby, David Kirkby, 17th September 2010) ===
  * #9917 Add a missing argument on line 678 of dpp.c. The code is fixed
    upstream, so the line is just taken from the upstream source code
    retrieved on 17th September 2010. Note, the upstream source code has
    many changes - only this, and the next change were put in Sage. We have
    NOT updated the ECL version to the latest unstable upstream version.
  * Removed an extra argument on line 680 of dpp.c Same comments as above.

=== ecl-10.2.1.p2 (David Kirkby, 30th July 2010) ===
  * #9643 Force ECL to disable assembly code on Solaris 10 as
    it does on OpenSolaris. The conditions for disabling
    assembly code were relaxed, so the release (Solaris 10
    or OpenSolaris) are now ignored.

=== ecl-10.2.1.p1 (Mitesh Patel, 11th July 2010) ===
  * Originally #9187, backported to 10.2.1:  Set an empty MAKEFLAGS
    variable before "make".  On OS X, at least, this fixes building
    multiple spkgs in parallel (cf. #8306).

=== ecl-10.2.1.p0 (David Kirkby, 11th July 2010) ===
  * #9474 Revert ECL back to version 10.2.1 (along with Maxima too)
    since some Maxima tests have failed on sage.math.
  * #8089 Add the configure option '--with-dffi=no' on
    OpenSolaris on the x86 processor. This disables assembly code.
    This was originally #8089, but is back-ported to 10.2.1
  * Delete temp files in /tmp, as they cause problems building
    ECL in a multi-user environment. This was originally
    #8951

=== ecl-10.2.1 (William Stein, 14 February 2010) ===
  * Upgrade to latest stable upstream release.

=== ecl-9.10.2-20091105cvs.p1 (William Stein, December 17, 2009) ===
  * Removed the encodings directory, since it contains potentially
    dangerous binary files.

=== ecl-9.10.2-20091105cvs.p0 (Mike Hansen, November 5, 2009) ===
  * Updated to the latest version of ECL.  This has a number of fixes
    in it, including the patch that was in patches/mach_dep.c.

=== ecl-9.8.4-20090913cvs.p3 (William Stein, Oct 14, 2009) ===
  * trac 7213 -- put * in right place in rm command to make
    sure ecl still works when sage is moved (properly delete old versions)

=== ecl-9.8.4-20090913cvs.p2 (William Stein, Oct 11, 2009) ===
  * trac 7186 -- make sure ecl still works when sage is moved

=== ecl-9.8.4-20090913cvs.p1 (William Stein, Sept 20th, 2009) ===
  * Make the name more canonical
  * Patch for boehm GC code to also work on OS X 10.6

=== ecl-9.8.4-cvs-13th-Sept-2009  (David Kirkby and Minh Van Nguyen, Sept 15th, 2009) ===
  * Download the latest CVS from the ECL web site, as version
    9.8.4 is acknowledged by the main ECL developer it will not work
    on 64-bit OS X
  * Correct failure to build on OS X ticket #6883 This replaces
    ./configure --prefix=$SAGE_LOCAL --with-system-gmp --enable-boehm=system
    with
    ./configure --prefix=SAGE_LOCAL
    in spkg-install.
  * Changed use of FFLAGS to FCFLAGS in spkg-install.
  * Set ABI to 64 and Export it. Only needed for OS X, but
    ignored on other platforms.
  * Print variable names, to aid debugging.
  * Unset make, as it appears to break parallel builds.

=== ecl-9.8.4 (David Kirkby, August 20th, 2009) ===
  * Updated to the latest 9.8.4 release of ECL (#6564)
  * removed the unneeded directory msvc from src to save disk space
  * Removed the patches directory, as there are none.
  * Changed spkg-install so no patches are applied.
  * Improved spkg-install so some sanity checks of the
    compilers takes place.
  * Enable all warnings on gcc.
  * Build 64-bit if SAGE64 is set to 'yes'
  * Removed the 'unset MAKE' in install-spkg.
  * Allow debug information to be removed from file, if
    SAGE_DEBUG is set to 'no', 'false' or '0'
    By default, debugging information will be supplied.
  * Removed an automatic addition of -g on 64-bit ( -g
    will be enable by default.)
  * Set CXXFLAGS and FFLAGS to have -m64 for a 64-bit build
    (originally only CFLAGS was done, yet there are C++ and
    Fortran files too).
  * Removed -m64 from LDFLAGS - it is not needed and unportable.
  * Add a check that someone is not mixing the Sun and GNU
    compilers.
  * Removed all the special build instructions from this file,
    as we are not sure they are needed.
  * Changed dependency note above from gmp to mpir.
  * Added my own name as a maintainer.

=== ecl-9.4.1 (Michael Abshoff, May 15th, 2009) ===
 * Initial version.
