From the website above: The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical
library for C and C++ programmers. It is free software under the GNU General
Public License.

The library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random
number generators, special functions and least-squares fitting. There are
over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite.

GSL mailing lists:

 * Bug-gsl <bug-gsl@gnu.org> mailing list -- bug reports for the GNU
   Scientific Library should be sent to bug-gsl@gnu.org
 * Help-gsl <help-gsl@gnu.org> users mailing list -- for questions about
   installation, how GSL works and how it is used, or general questions
   concerning GSL.
 * Info-gsl <info-gsl@gnu.org> mailing list -- announcements of new releases
   are made there.

== Dependencies ==

 * ATLAS, but it seems to be only required when actually linking the gsl
   extensions

== Changelog ==

=== gsl-1.14 (David Kirkby, 17th July 2010) ===
 * #9533 Update GSL to the latest upstream release - the previous
   version (1.10) was nearly 3 years old.
 * Reformatted this file for 80 characters width.
 * Added 'exit 1' to spkg-install so the build terminates
   if 'configure' fails to run properly.
 * Same as above, when running 'make'
 * Same as above, when running 'make install'
 * Removed the option --enable-shared from the
   configure script, as the default is to make
   shared libraries (see src/INSTALL)
 * Removed patches. I doubt they are useful when they
   are on a version of GSL that is nearly 3 years old.
   It is better to resolve problems if found, rather than try
   to use patches made against a very outdated version of GSL.
 * Used $MAKE for building, as building in parallel is
   reliable.
 * $MAKE is also used in spkg-check for testing GSL in
   parallel. The GSL has been tested on around 50 builds in
   total on Linux, OpenSolaris, OS X and Solaris. Each time
   all the self-tests of GSL pass. From 2 to 1000 threads were
   used.
 * Removed reference to GPL 2 in earlier releases - it is
   irrelevant what licence previous releases of GSL were
   released under.
 * Removed notes about patches on OS X. GSL would appear to
   handle OS X properly.
