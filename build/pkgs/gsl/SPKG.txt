From the website above: The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical library for C and C++ programmers. It is free software under the GNU General Public License.

The library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random number generators, special functions and least-squares fitting. There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite.

== Upstream Contact ==

GSL mailing lists:

 * Bug-gsl <bug-gsl@gnu.org> mailing list -- bug reports for the GNU Scientific Library should be sent here
 * Help-gsl <help-gsl@gnu.org> users mailing list -- for questions about installation, how GSL works and how it is used, or general questions concerning GSL.
 * Info-gsl <info-gsl@gnu.org> mailing list -- announcements of new releases are made here.

== Dependencies ==

 * ATLAS, but it seems to be only required when actually linking the gsl extensions

== Changelog ==

=== gsl-1.14 (David Kirkby, 17th July 2010) ===
 * #9533 Update GSL to the latest upstream release - the previous
   version was nearly 3 years old.
 * Added 'exit 1' to spkg-install so the build terminates
   if 'configure' fails to run properly.
 * Same as above, when running 'make'
 * Same as above, when running 'make install'
 * Removed the option --enable-shared from the
   configure script, as the default is to make
   shared libraries (see src/INSTALL)
 * Removed patches. I doubt they are useful when they
   are on a version of GSL that is nearly 3 years old.
   It is better to resolve problems if found, rather than try
   to patch a very updated version of GSL.
 * Remove the compiler options -O2 -g, since GSL defaults to
   those options.
 * Used $MAKE for building, as builing in parallel seems
   relieable.

=== gsl-1.10.p2 (Jaap Spies,  Jan 25th, 2010) ===
 * Made SAGE64=yes work for Open Solaris 64 bit
 * Removed Michael as maintainer

=== gsl-1.10.p1 (Michael Abshoff, April 20th, 2008) ===
 * always use GSL's isinf (fixes #2973)

=== gsl-1.10-p0 (Michael Abshoff, Jan. 26, 2008) ===
 * fix 64 OSX build
 * fix spkg-check target
 * work around isinf bug on OSX

=== gsl-1.10 (Michael Abshoff, Jan. 25, 2008) ===
 * update to gsl 1.10
 * add .hgignore
 * write proper SPKG.txt

=== gsl-1.9 ===
 * initial release

== Build Notes ==
 * On OSX we use a slighly modified isinf method since the system one is buggy. See the patches directory for a patch
