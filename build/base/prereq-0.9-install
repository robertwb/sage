# From Kate Minola kate01123@gmail.com
# On my powerpc-Darwin machine with csh as my shell, when I attempt
# to build SAGE in the background (i.e., "make &") the build
# stops when executing 'prereq-0.2-install'.  The reason is
# that the line
#     which $1 > /dev/null
# issues a SIGTTOU signal (background process attempting to write
# to tty).  Solution:
trap '' TTOU

# does not update the base packages and we cannot retro-actively change
# that in earlier versions.  So the only thing to do is to skip this
