def vectors_by_length(self, bound):
    """
    Returns a list of short vectors together with their values.

    This is a maive algorithm which uses the Cholesky decomposition,
    but does not use the LLL-reduction algorithm.

    OUTPUT:
        A list L of length (bound + 1) whose entry L[i] is a list of
        all vectors of length i.

    Reference: This is a slightly modified version of Cohn's Algorithm
    2.7.5 in "A Course in Compuational Number Theory", with the
    increment step moved around and slightly reindexed to allow clean
    looping.

    Note: We could speed this up for very skew matrices by using LLL
    first, and then changing coordinates back, but for our purposes
    the simpler method is efficient enough. =)

    Technical Notes: There is a minor difference in the cancellation
    code here (form the C++ version) since the notation Q[i,j] indexes
    coefficients of the quadratic polynomial here, not the symmetric
