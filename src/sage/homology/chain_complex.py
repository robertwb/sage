Chain complexes

This module implements chain complexes of free `R`-modules, for any
commutative ring `R` (although the interesting things, like homology,
only work if `R` is the integers or a field).

Fix a ring `R`.  A chain complex over `R` is a collection of
`R`-modules `\{C_n\}` indexed by the integers, with `R`-module maps
`d_n : C_n \rightarrow C_{n+1}` such that `d_{n+1} \circ d_n = 0` for
all `n`.  The maps `d_n` are called *differentials*.

One can vary this somewhat: the differentials may decrease degree by
one instead of increasing it: sometimes a chain complex is defined
with `d_n : C_n \rightarrow C_{n-1}` for each `n`. Indeed, the
differentials may change dimension by any fixed integer.

Also, the modules may be indexed over an abelian group other than the
integers, e.g., `\ZZ^{m}` for some integer `m \geq 1`, in which
case the differentials may change the grading by any element of that
grading group.

In this implementation, the ring `R` must be commutative and the
modules `C_n` must be free `R`-modules.  As noted above, homology
calculations will only work if the ring `R` is either `\ZZ` or a field.
The modules may be indexed by any free abelian group.  The
differentials may increase degree by 1 or decrease it, or indeed
change it by any fixed amount: this is controlled by the ``degree``
parameter used in defining the chain complex.

    Preprocess a matrix using the "Elimination algorithm" described by
    Dumas et al. [DHSW]_, and then call ``elementary_divisors`` on the
    resulting (smaller) matrix.

    .. NOTE::

        'snf' stands for 'Smith Normal Form.'

    INPUT:

    -  ``mat`` -- an integer matrix, either sparse or dense.

    (They use the transpose of the matrix considered here, so they use
    rows instead of columns.)

    Algorithm: go through ``mat`` one column at a time.  For each
    column, add multiples of previous columns to it until either

    - it's zero, in which case it should be deleted.
    - its first nonzero entry is 1 or -1, in which case it should be kept.
    - its first nonzero entry is something else, in which case it is
      deferred until the second pass.

    Then do a second pass on the deferred columns.

    At this point, the columns with 1 or -1 in the first entry
    contribute to the rank of the matrix, and these can be counted and
    then deleted (after using the 1 or -1 entry to clear out its row).
    Suppose that there were `N` of these.

    The resulting matrix should be much smaller; we then feed it
    to Sage's ``elementary_divisors`` function, and prepend `N` 1's to
    account for the rows deleted in the previous step.

    Define a chain complex.

    INPUT:

       more details.

    -  ``base_ring`` -- a commutative ring (optional), the ring over
       which the chain complex is defined. If this is not specified,
       it is determined by the data defining the chain complex.

    -  ``grading_group`` -- a free abelian group (optional, default
       ``ZZ``), the group over which the chain complex is indexed.

    -  ``degree`` -- element of grading_group (optional, default 1),
       the degree of the differential.

    -  ``check_products`` -- boolean (optional, default ``True``). If
       ``True``, check that each consecutive pair of differentials are
       composable and have composite equal to zero.

    OUTPUT: a chain complex

    .. WARNING::

       Right now, homology calculations will only work if the base
       ring is either `\ZZ` or a field, so please take this into account
       when defining a chain complex.

    Use data to define the chain complex.  This may be in any of the
    following forms.

    1. a dictionary with integers (or more generally, elements of
       grading_group) for keys, and with ``data[n]`` a matrix representing
       (via left multiplication) the differential coming from degree
       `n`.  (Note that the shape of the matrix then determines the
       rank of the free modules `C_n` and `C_{n+d}`.)

    2. a list or tuple of the form `[C_0, d_0, C_1, d_1, C_2, d_2,
       ...]`, where each `C_i` is a free module and each `d_i` is a
       matrix, as above.  This only makes sense if ``grading_group``
       is `\ZZ` and ``degree`` is 1.

    3. a list or tuple of the form `[r_0, d_0, r_1, d_1, r_2, d_2,
       ...]`, where `r_i` is the rank of the free module `C_i` and
       each `d_i` is a matrix, as above.  This only makes sense if
       ``grading_group`` is `\ZZ` and ``degree`` is 1.

    4. a list or tuple of the form `[d_0, d_1, d_2, ...]` where each
       `d_i` is a matrix, as above.  This only makes sense if
       ``grading_group`` is `\ZZ` and ``degree`` is 1.

    .. NOTE::

       In fact, the free modules `C_i` in case 2 and the ranks `r_i`
       in case 3 are ignored: only the matrices are kept, and from
       their shapes, the ranks of the modules are determined.
       (Indeed, if ``data`` is a list or tuple, then any element which
       is not a matrix is discarded; thus the list may have any number
       of different things in it, and all of the non-matrices will be
       ignored.)  No error checking is done to make sure, for
       instance, that the given modules have the appropriate ranks for
       the given matrices.  However, as long as ``check_products`` is
       True, the code checks to see if the matrices are composable and
       that each appropriate composite is zero.

    If the base ring is not specified, then the matrices are examined
    to determine a ring over which they are all naturally defined, and
    this becomes the base ring for the complex.  If no such ring can
    be found, an error is raised.  If the base ring is specified, then
    the matrices are converted automatically to this ring when
    defining the chain complex.  If some matrix cannot be converted,
    then an error is raised.

        sage: D == loads(dumps(D))

    Note that when a chain complex is defined in Sage, new
    differentials may be created: every nonzero module in the chain
    complex must have a differential coming from it, even if that
    differential is zero::

        sage: IZ = ChainComplex({0: identity_matrix(ZZ, 1)})

           every dimension in which the chain complex is possibly
           nonzero.

        -  ``base_ring`` -- a commutative ring (optional, default is the
           base ring for the chain complex).  Must be either the
           integers `\ZZ` or a field.

        -  ``generators`` -- boolean (optional, default False).  If
           True, return generators for the homology groups along with
           the groups.

           .. NOTE::

               This is only implemented if the CHomP package is available.

        -  ``verbose`` - boolean (optional, default ``False``).  If
           ``True``, print some messages as the homology is computed.

        -  ``algorithm`` - string (optional, default ``'auto'``).  The
           options are ``'auto'``, ``'dhsw'``, ``'pari'`` or ``'no_chomp'``.
           See below for descriptions.

        OUTPUT: if dim is specified, the homology in dimension dim.
        Otherwise, the homology in every dimension as a dictionary
        indexed by dimension.

        ALGORITHM:

        If ``algorithm`` is set to ``'auto'`` (the default), then use
        CHomP if available.  (CHomP is available at the web page
        http://chomp.rutgers.edu/.  It is also an experimental package
        for Sage.)

        CHomP computes homology, not cohomology, and only works over
        the integers or finite prime fields.  Therefore if any of
        these conditions fails, or if CHomP is not present, or if
        ``algorithm`` is set to 'no_chomp', go to plan B: if ``self``
        has a ``_homology`` method -- each simplicial complex has
        this, for example -- then call that.  Such a method implements
        specialized algorithms for the particular type of cell
        complex.

        Otherwise, move on to plan C: compute the chain complex of
        ``self`` and compute its homology groups.  To do this: over a
        field, just compute ranks and nullities, thus obtaining
        dimensions of the homology groups as vector spaces.  Over the
        integers, compute Smith normal form of the boundary matrices
        defining the chain complex according to the value of
        ``algorithm``.  If ``algorithm`` is ``'auto'`` or ``'no_chomp'``,
        then for each relatively small matrix, use the standard Sage
        method, which calls the Pari package.  For any large matrix,
        reduce it using the Dumas, Heckenbach, Saunders, and Welker
        elimination algorithm [DHSW]_: see
        :func:`~sage.homology.chain_complex.dhsw_snf` for details.

        Finally, ``algorithm`` may also be ``'pari'`` or ``'dhsw'``, which
        forces the named algorithm to be used regardless of the size
        of the matrices and regardless of whether CHomP is available.

        As of this writing, CHomP is by far the fastest option,
        followed by the ``'auto'`` or ``'no_chomp'`` setting of using the
        Dumas, Heckenbach, Saunders, and Welker elimination algorithm
        [DHSW]_ for large matrices and Pari for small ones.

        .. WARNING::

           This only works if the base ring is the integers or a
           field.  Other values will return an error.

            sage: C = ChainComplex({0: matrix(ZZ, 2, 3, [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])})
