Examples of simplicial complexes

This file constructs some examples of simplicial complexes.  There are
two main types: manifolds and examples related to graph theory.

For manifolds, there are functions defining the `n`-sphere for any
`n`, the torus, `n`-dimensional real projective space for any `n`, the
complex projective plane, surfaces of arbitrary genus, and some other
manifolds, all as simplicial complexes.

Aside from surfaces, this file also provides some functions for
constructing some other simplicial complexes: the simplicial complex
of not-`i`-connected graphs on `n` vertices, the matching complex on n
vertices, and the chessboard complex for an `n` by `i` chessboard.
These provide examples of large simplicial complexes; for example,
``simplicial_complexes.NotIConnectedGraphs(7,2)`` has over a million
simplices.

All of these examples are accessible by typing
"simplicial_complexes.NAME", where "NAME" is the name of the example.
You can get a list by typing "simplicial_complexes." and hitting the
TAB key::

        identification space of the `3q`-gon.  To triangulate this
        identification space, put `q` vertices `A_0`, ..., `A_{q-1}`,
        in the interior, each of which is connected to 1, 2, 3 (two
        facets each: `[1, 2, A_i]`, `[2, 3, A_i]`).  Put `q` more

        A triangulation of `\Bold{R}P^n` for any `n \geq 0`.

        INPUT:

        - ``n`` - integer, the dimension of the real projective space
          to construct

        The first few cases are pretty trivial:

        - `\Bold{R}P^0` is a point.

        - `\Bold{R}P^1` is a circle, triangulated as the boundary of a
          single 2-simplex.

        - `\Bold{R}P^2` is the real projective plane, here given its
          minimal triangulation with 6 vertices, 15 edges, and 10
          triangles.

        - `\Bold{R}P^3`: any triangulation has at least 11 vertices by
          a result of Walkup; this function returns a
          triangulation with 11 vertices, as given by Lutz.

        - `\Bold{R}P^4`: any triangulation has at least 16 vertices by
          a result of Walkup; this function returns a triangulation
          with 16 vertices as given by Lutz; see also Datta, Example
          3.12.

        - `\Bold{R}P^n`: Lutz has found a triangulation of
          `\Bold{R}P^5` with 24 vertices, but it does not seem to have
          been published.  Kühnel has described a triangulation of
          `\Bold{R}P^n`, in general, with `2^{n+1}-1` vertices; see
          also Datta, Example 3.21.  This triangulation is presumably
          not minimal, but it seems to be the best in the published
          literature as of this writing.  So this function returns it
          when `n > 4`.

        ALGORITHM: For `n < 4`, these are constructed explicitly by
        listing the facets.  For `n = 4`, this is constructed by
        specifying 16 vertices, two facets, and a certain subgroup `G`
        of the symmetric group `S_{16}`.  Then the set of all facets
        is the `G`-orbit of the two given facets.

        For `n > 4`, the construction is as follows: let `S` denote
        the simplicial complex structure on the `n`-sphere given by
        the first barycentric subdivision of the boundary of an
        `(n+1)`-simplex.  This has a simplicial antipodal action: if
        `V` denotes the vertices in the boundary of the simplex, then
        the vertices in its barycentric subdivision `S` correspond to
        nonempty proper subsets `U` of `V`, and the antipodal action
        sends any subset `U` to its complement.  One can show that
        modding out by this action results in a triangulation for
        `\Bold{R}P^n`.  To find the facets in this triangulation, find
        the facets in `S`.  These are indentified in pairs to form
        `\Bold{R}P^n`, so choose a representative from each pair: for
        each facet in `S`, replace any vertex in `S` containing 0 with
        its complement.

        Of course these complexes increase in size pretty quickly as
        `n` increases.

        Fix an integer `n>0` and consider the set of graphs on `n`

        `i`-connected if, for any `j<i`, if any `j` vertices are

        is not `i`-connected, then the same is true for any graph
        obtained from `G` by deleting edges. Thus the set of all

        The chessboard complex for an n by i chessboard.

        Fix integers `n, i > 0` and consider sets `V` of `n` vertices
        and `W` of `i` vertices.  A 'partial matching' between `V` and
        `W` is a graph formed by edges `(v,w)` with `v \in V` and `w

        possible edges, is closed under taking subsets, and thus forms
        a simplicial complex called the 'chessboard complex'.  This

        A random ``d``-dimensional simplicial complex on ``n``
        vertices.

        INPUT:

        - ``n`` - number of vertices
        - ``d`` - dimension of the complex
        -  ``p`` - floating point number between 0 and 1
           (optional, default 0.5)

        A random `d`-dimensional simplicial complex on `n` vertices,
        as defined for example by Meshulam and Wallach, is constructed
        as follows: take `n` vertices and include all of the simplices
        of dimension strictly less than `d`, and then for each
        possible simplex of dimension `d`, include it with probability
        `p`.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: simplicial_complexes.RandomComplex(6, 2)
            Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and 15 facets

        If `d` is too large (if `d > n+1`, so that there are no
        `d`-dimensional simplices), then return the simplicial complex
        with a single `(n+1)`-dimensional simplex::

            sage: simplicial_complexes.RandomComplex(6,12)
