Morphisms of Toric Varieties

There are three "obvious" ways to map toric varieties to toric
varieties:

1. Polynomial maps in local coordinates, the usual morphisms in
   algebraic geometry.

2. Polynomial maps in the (global) homogeneous coordinates.

3. Toric morphisms, that is, algebraic morphisms equivariant with
   respect to the torus action on the toric variety.

Both 2 and 3 are special cases of 1, which is just to say that we
always remain within the realm of algebraic geometry. But apart from
that, none is included in one of the other cases. In the examples
below, we will explore some algebraic maps that can or can not be
written as a toric morphism. Often a toric morphism can be written
with polynomial maps in homogeneous coordinates, but sometimes it
cannot.

The toric morphisms are perhaps the most mysterious at the
beginning. Let us quickly review their definition (See Definition
3.3.3 of [CLS]_). Let `\Sigma_1` be a fan in `N_{1,\RR}` and `\Sigma_2` be a
fan in `N_{2,\RR}`. A morphism `\phi: X_{\Sigma_1} \to X_{\Sigma_2}`
of the associated toric varieties is toric if `\phi` maps the maximal
torus `T_{N_1} \subseteq X_{\Sigma_1}` into `T_{N_2} \subseteq
X_{\Sigma_2}` and `\phi|_{T_N}` is a group homomorphism.

The data defining a toric morphism is precisely what defines a fan
morphism (see :mod:`~sage.geometry.fan_morphism`), extending the more
familiar dictionary between toric varieties and fans. Toric geometry
is a functor from the category of fans and fan morphisms to the
category of toric varieties and toric morphisms.

.. note::

    Do not create the toric morphisms (or any morphism of schemes)
    directly from the the ``SchemeMorphism...`` classes. Instead, use the
    :meth:`~sage.schemes.generic.scheme.hom` method common to all
    algebraic schemes to create new homomorphisms.

EXAMPLES:

First, consider the following embedding of `\mathbb{P}^1` into
`\mathbb{P}^2` ::

    sage: P2.<x,y,z> = toric_varieties.P2()
    sage: P1.<u,v> = toric_varieties.P1()
    sage: P1.hom([0,u^2+v^2,u*v], P2)
    Scheme morphism:
      From: 1-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 2 affine patches
      To:   2-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 3 affine patches
      Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending [u : v] to
            [0 : u^2 + v^2 : u*v]

This is a well-defined morphism of algebraic varieties because
homogeneously rescaled coordinates of a point of `\mathbb{P}^1` map to the same
point in `\mathbb{P}^2` up to its homogeneous rescalings. It is not
equivariant with respect to the torus actions

.. math::

    \CC^\times \times \mathbb{P}^1,
    (\mu,[u:v]) \mapsto [u:\mu v]
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \left(\CC^\times\right)^2 \times \mathbb{P}^2,
    ((\alpha,\beta),[x:y:z]) \mapsto [x:\alpha y:\beta z]
    ,

hence it is not a toric morphism. Clearly, the problem is that
the map in homogeneous coordinates contains summands that transform
differently under the torus action. However, this is not the only
difficulty. For example, consider ::

    sage: phi = P1.hom([0,u,v], P2);  phi
    Scheme morphism:
      From: 1-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 2 affine patches
      To:   2-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 3 affine patches
      Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending [u : v] to
            [0 : u : v]

This map is actually the embedding of the
:meth:`~sage.schemes.toric.variety.ToricVariety_field.orbit_closure`
associated to one of the rays of the fan of `\mathbb{P}^2`. Now the
morphism is equivariant with respect to **some** map `\CC^\times \to
(\CC^\times)^2` of the maximal tori of `\mathbb{P}^1` and
`\mathbb{P}^2`. But this map of the maximal tori cannot be the same as
``phi`` defined above. Indeed, the image of ``phi`` completely misses
the maximal torus `T_{\mathbb{P}^2} = \{ [x:y:z] | x\not=0, y\not=0,
z\not=0 \}` of `\mathbb{P}^2`.

Consider instead the following morphism of fans::

    sage: fm = FanMorphism( matrix(ZZ,[[1,0]]), P1.fan(), P2.fan() );  fm
    Fan morphism defined by the matrix
    [1 0]
    Domain fan: Rational polyhedral fan in 1-d lattice N
    Codomain fan: Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N

which also defines a morphism of toric varieties::

    sage: P1.hom(fm, P2)
    Scheme morphism:
      From: 1-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 2 affine patches
      To:   2-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 3 affine patches
      Defn: Defined by sending Rational polyhedral fan in 1-d lattice N
            to Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N.

The fan morphism map is equivalent to the following polynomial map::

    sage: _.as_polynomial_map()
    Scheme morphism:
      From: 1-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 2 affine patches
      To:   2-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 3 affine patches
      Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending [u : v] to
            [u : v : v]

Finally, here is an example of a fan morphism that cannot be written
using homogeneous polynomials. Consider the blowup `O_{\mathbb{P}^1}(2)
\to \CC^2/\ZZ_2`. In terms of toric data, this blowup is::

    sage: A2_Z2 = toric_varieties.A2_Z2()
    sage: A2_Z2.fan().rays()
    N(1, 0),
    N(1, 2)
    in 2-d lattice N
    sage: O2_P1 = A2_Z2.resolve(new_rays=[(1,1)])
    sage: blowup = O2_P1.hom(identity_matrix(2), A2_Z2)
    sage: blowup.as_polynomial_map()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: The fan morphism cannot be written in homogeneous polynomials.

If we denote the homogeneous coordinates of `O_{\mathbb{P}^1}(2)` by
`x`, `t`, `y` corresponding to the rays `(1,2)`, `(1,1)`, and `(1,0)`
then the blow-up map is [BB]_:

.. math::

    f: O_{\mathbb{P}^1}(2) \to \CC^2/\ZZ_2, \quad
    (x,t,y) \mapsto \left( x\sqrt{t}, y\sqrt{t} \right)

which requires square roots.
