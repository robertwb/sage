Fano toric varieties

This module provides support for (Crepant Partial Resolutions of) Fano toric
varieties, corresponding to crepant subdivisions of face fans of reflexive
:class:`lattice polytopes
<sage.geometry.lattice_polytope.LatticePolytopeClass>`.
The interface is provided via :func:`CPRFanoToricVariety`.

A careful exposition of different flavours of Fano varieties can be found in
the paper by Benjamin Nill [Nill2005]_. The main goal of this module is to
support work with **Gorenstein weak Fano toric varieties**. Such a variety
corresponds to a **coherent crepant refinement of the normal fan of a
reflexive polytope** `\Delta`, where crepant means that primitive generators
of the refining rays lie on the facets of the polar polytope `\Delta^\circ`
and coherent (a.k.a. regular or projective) means that there exists a strictly
upper convex piecewise linear function whose domains of linearity are
precisely the maximal cones of the subdivision. These varieties are important
for string theory in physics, as they serve as ambient spaces for mirror pairs
of Calabi-Yau manifolds via constructions due to Victor V. Batyrev
[Batyrev1994]_ and Lev A. Borisov [Borisov1993]_.

From the combinatorial point of view "crepant" requirement is much more simple
and natural to work with than "coherent." For this reason, the code in this
module will allow work with arbitrary crepant subdivisions without checking
whether they are coherent or not. We refer to corresponding toric varieties as
**CPR-Fano toric varieties**.

EXAMPLES:

Most of the functions available for Fano toric varieties are the same as
for general toric varieties, so here we will concentrate only on
Calabi-Yau subvarieties, which were the primary goal for creating this
module.

For our first example we realize the projective plane as a Fano toric
variety::

    sage: simplex = lattice_polytope.projective_space(2)
    sage: P2 = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=simplex)

Its anticanonical "hypersurface" is a one-dimensional Calabi-Yau
manifold::

    sage: P2.anticanonical_hypersurface(
    ...         monomial_points="all")
    Closed subscheme of 2-d CPR-Fano toric variety
    covered by 3 affine patches defined by:
      a0*z0^3 + a9*z0^2*z1 + a7*z0*z1^2
    + a1*z1^3 + a8*z0^2*z2 + a6*z0*z1*z2
    + a4*z1^2*z2 + a5*z0*z2^2
    + a3*z1*z2^2 + a2*z2^3

In many cases it is sufficient to work with the "simplified polynomial
moduli space" of anticanonical hypersurfaces::

    sage: P2.anticanonical_hypersurface(
    ...         monomial_points="simplified")
    Closed subscheme of 2-d CPR-Fano toric variety
    covered by 3 affine patches defined by:
      a0*z0^3 + a1*z1^3 + a6*z0*z1*z2 + a2*z2^3

The mirror family to these hypersurfaces lives inside the Fano toric
variety obtained using ``simplex`` as ``Delta`` instead of ``Delta_polar``::

    sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta=simplex,
    ...         coordinate_points="all")
    sage: FTV.anticanonical_hypersurface(
    ...         monomial_points="simplified")
    Closed subscheme of 2-d CPR-Fano toric variety
    covered by 9 affine patches defined by:
      a2*z2^3*z3^2*z4*z5^2*z8
    + a1*z1^3*z3*z4^2*z7^2*z9
    + a3*z0*z1*z2*z3*z4*z5*z7*z8*z9
    + a0*z0^3*z5*z7*z8^2*z9^2

Here we have taken the resolved version of the ambient space for the
mirror family, but in fact we don't have to resolve singularities
corresponding to the interior points of facets - they are singular
points which do not lie on a generic anticanonical hypersurface::

    sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta=simplex,
    ...         coordinate_points="all but facets")
    sage: FTV.anticanonical_hypersurface(
    ...         monomial_points="simplified")
    Closed subscheme of 2-d CPR-Fano toric variety
    covered by 3 affine patches defined by:
      a0*z0^3 + a1*z1^3 + a3*z0*z1*z2 + a2*z2^3

This looks very similar to our second version of the anticanonical
hypersurface of the projective plane, as expected, since all
one-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds are elliptic curves!

Now let's take a look at a toric realization of `M`-polarized K3 surfaces
studied by Adrian Clingher and Charles F. Doran in [CD2007]_::

    sage: p4318 = ReflexivePolytope(3, 4318)  # long
    sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=p4318)  # long
    sage: FTV.anticanonical_hypersurface()  # long
    Closed subscheme of 3-d CPR-Fano toric variety
    covered by 4 affine patches defined by:
      a3*z2^12 + a4*z2^6*z3^6 + a2*z3^12
    + a8*z0*z1*z2*z3 + a0*z1^3 + a1*z0^2

Below you will find detailed descriptions of available functions. Current
functionality of this module is very basic, but it is under active
development and hopefully will improve in future releases of Sage. If there
are some particular features that you would like to see implemented ASAP,
please consider reporting them to the Sage Development Team or even
implementing them on your own as a patch for inclusion!

    Construct a CPR-Fano toric variety.

    .. NOTE::

        See documentation of the module
        :mod:`~sage.schemes.generic.fano_toric_variety` for the used
        definitions and supported varieties.

    Due to the large number of available options, it is recommended to always
    use keyword parameters.

    INPUT:

    - ``Delta`` -- reflexive :class:`lattice polytope
      <sage.geometry.lattice_polytope.LatticePolytopeClass>`. The fan of the
      constructed CPR-Fano toric variety will be a crepant subdivision of the
      *normal fan* of ``Delta``. Either ``Delta`` or ``Delta_polar`` must be
      given, but not both at the same time, since one is completely determined
      by another via :meth:`polar
      <sage.geometry.lattice_polytope.LatticePolytopeClass.polar>` method;

    - ``Delta_polar`` -- reflexive :class:`lattice polytope
      <sage.geometry.lattice_polytope.LatticePolytopeClass>`. The fan of the
      constructed CPR-Fano toric variety will be a crepant subdivision of the
      *face fan* of ``Delta_polar``. Either ``Delta`` or ``Delta_polar`` must
      be given, but not both at the same time, since one is completely
      determined by another via :meth:`polar
      <sage.geometry.lattice_polytope.LatticePolytopeClass.polar>` method;

    - ``coordinate_points`` -- list of integers or string. A list will be
      interpreted as indices of (boundary) points of ``Delta_polar`` which
      should be used as rays of the underlying fan. It must include all
      vertices of ``Delta_polar`` and no repetitions are allowed. A string
      must be one of the following descriptions of points of ``Delta_polar``:

      * "vertices" (default),
      * "all" (will not include the origin),
      * "all but facets" (will not include points in the relative interior of
        facets);

    - ``charts`` -- list of lists of elements from ``coordinate_points``. Each
      of these lists must define a generating cone of a fan subdividing the
      normal fan of ``Delta``. Default ``charts`` correspond to the normal fan
      of ``Delta`` without subdivision. The fan specified by ``charts`` will
      be subdivided to include all of the requested ``coordinate_points``;

    - ``coordinate_names`` -- names of variables for the coordinate ring, see
      :func:`~sage.schemes.generic.toric_variety.normalize_names`
      for acceptable formats. If not given, indexed variable names will be
      created automatically;

    - ``coordinate_name_indices`` -- list of integers, indices for indexed
      variables. If not given, the index of each variable will coincide with
      the index of the corresponding point of ``Delta_polar``;

    - ``make_simplicial`` -- if ``True``, the underlying fan will be made
      simplicial (default: ``False``);

    - ``base_field`` -- base field of the CPR-Fano toric variety
      (default: `\QQ`);

    - ``check`` -- by default the input data will be checked for correctness
      (e.g. that ``charts`` do form a subdivision of the normal fan of
      ``Delta``). If you know for sure that the input is valid, you may
      significantly decrease construction time using ``check=False`` option.

    OUTPUT:

    - :class:`CPR-Fano toric variety <CPRFanoToricVariety_field>`.

    EXAMPLES:

    We start with the product of two projective lines::

        sage: diamond = lattice_polytope.octahedron(2)
        sage: diamond.vertices()
        [ 1  0 -1  0]
        [ 0  1  0 -1]
        sage: P1xP1 = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=diamond)
        sage: P1xP1
        2-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 4 affine patches
        sage: P1xP1.fan()
        Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N
        sage: P1xP1.fan().ray_matrix()
        [ 1  0 -1  0]
        [ 0  1  0 -1]

    "Unfortunately," this variety is smooth to start with and we cannot
    perform any subdivisions of the underlying fan without leaving the
    category of CPR-Fano toric varieties. Our next example starts with a
    square::

        sage: square = diamond.polar()
        sage: square.vertices()
        [-1  1 -1  1]
        [ 1  1 -1 -1]
        sage: square.points()
        [-1  1 -1  1 -1  0  0  0  1]
        [ 1  1 -1 -1  0 -1  0  1  0]

    We will construct several varieties associated to it::

        sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=square)
        sage: FTV.fan().ray_matrix()
        [-1  1 -1  1]
        [ 1  1 -1 -1]
        sage: FTV.gens()
        (z0, z1, z2, z3)

        sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=square,
        ...         coordinate_points=[0,1,2,3,8])
        sage: FTV.fan().ray_matrix()
        [-1  1 -1  1  1]
        [ 1  1 -1 -1  0]
        sage: FTV.gens()
        (z0, z1, z2, z3, z8)

        sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=square,
        ...         coordinate_points=[8,0,2,1,3],
        ...         coordinate_names="x+")
        sage: FTV.fan().ray_matrix()
        [ 1 -1 -1  1  1]
        [ 0  1 -1  1 -1]
        sage: FTV.gens()
        (x8, x0, x2, x1, x3)

        sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=square,
        ...         coordinate_points="all",
        ...         coordinate_names="x y Z+")
        sage: FTV.fan().ray_matrix()
        [-1  1 -1  1 -1  0  0  1]
        [ 1  1 -1 -1  0 -1  1  0]
        sage: FTV.gens()
        (x, y, Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5, Z7, Z8)

    Note that ``Z6`` is "missing". This is due to the fact that the 6-th point
    of ``square`` is the origin, and all automatically created names have the
    same indices as corresponding points of
    :meth:`~CPRFanoToricVariety_field.Delta_polar`. This is usually very
    convenient, especially if you have to work with several partial
    resolutions of the same Fano toric variety. However, you can change it, if
    you want::

        sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=square,
        ...         coordinate_points="all",
        ...         coordinate_names="x y Z+",
        ...         coordinate_name_indices=range(8))
        sage: FTV.gens()
        (x, y, Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5, Z6, Z7)

    Note that you have to provide indices for *all* variables, including those
    that have "completely custom" names. Again, this is usually convenient,
    because you can add or remove "custom" variables without disturbing too
    much "automatic" ones::

        sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=square,
        ...         coordinate_points="all",
        ...         coordinate_names="x Z+",
        ...         coordinate_name_indices=range(8))
        sage: FTV.gens()
        (x, Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5, Z6, Z7)

    If you prefer to always start from zero, you will have to shift indices
    accordingly::

        sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=square,
        ...         coordinate_points="all",
        ...         coordinate_names="x Z+",
        ...         coordinate_name_indices=[0] + range(7))
        sage: FTV.gens()
        (x, Z0, Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5, Z6)

        sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=square,
        ...         coordinate_points="all",
        ...         coordinate_names="x y Z+",
        ...         coordinate_name_indices=[0]*2 + range(6))
        sage: FTV.gens()
        (x, y, Z0, Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5)

    So you always can get any names you want, somewhat complicated default
    behaviour was designed with the hope that in most cases you will have no
    desire to provide different names.

    Now we will use the possibility to specify initial charts::

        sage: charts = [(0,1), (1,3), (3,2), (2,0)]

    (these charts actually form exactly the face fan of our square) ::

        sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=square,
        ...         coordinate_points=[0,1,2,3,4],
        ...         charts=charts)
        sage: FTV.fan().ray_matrix()
        [-1  1 -1  1 -1]
        [ 1  1 -1 -1  0]
        sage: [cone.ambient_ray_indices() for cone in FTV.fan()]
        [(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (0, 4)]

    If charts are wrong, it should be detected::

        sage: bad_charts = charts + [(2,0)]
        sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=square,
        ...         coordinate_points=[0,1,2,3,4],
        ...         charts=bad_charts)
        d...: UserWarning: you have provided a non-minimal set
        of generating cones, 1 of them were discarded!
        sage: FTV.fan().ray_matrix()
        [-1  1 -1  1 -1]
        [ 1  1 -1 -1  0]
        sage: [cone.ambient_ray_indices() for cone in FTV.fan()]
        [(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (0, 4)]

    OK, everything still works but that's because these charts still define a
    valid fan, they just happened to list one cone twice and it was discarded
    by the fan constructor. However, when you try to speed up your code such
    charts are indeed bad::

        sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=square,
        ...         coordinate_points=[0,1,2,3,4],
        ...         charts=bad_charts,
        ...         check=False)
        sage: FTV.fan().ray_matrix()
        [-1  1 -1  1 -1]
        [ 1  1 -1 -1  0]
        sage: [cone.ambient_ray_indices() for cone in FTV.fan()]
        [(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (0, 4), (2, 4), (0, 4)]

    The last line shows two of the generating cones twice. While "everything
    still works" in the sense "it does not crash," any work with such a
    variety may lead to mathematically wrong results, so use ``check=False``
    carefully!

    Let's also look at some of the mistakes which are reported, rather than
    fixed::

        sage: bad_charts = charts + [(0,3)]
        sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=square,

            does not include all of the required names for generic monomial
            coefficients, it will be automatically extended.

        Below `\Delta` is the reflexive polytope corresponding to ``self``,
        i.e. the fan of ``self`` is a refinement of the normal fan of
        `\Delta`. This function accepts only keyword parameters.

          interpreted as indices of points of `\Delta` which should be used
          for monomials of this hypersurface. A string must be one of the
          following descriptions of points of `\Delta`:

          * "vertices",
          * "vertices+origin",
          * "all",
          * "simplified" (default) -- all points of `\Delta` except for
            the interior points of facets, this choice corresponds to working
            with the "simplified polynomial moduli space" of anticanonical
            hypersurfaces;

        - ``coefficient_names`` -- names for the monomial coefficients, see
          :func:`~sage.schemes.generic.toric_variety.normalize_names`
          for acceptable formats. If not given, indexed coefficient names will
          be created automatically;

        - ``coefficient_name_indices`` -- list of integers, indices for
          indexed coefficients. If not given, the index of each coefficient
          will coincide with the index of the corresponding point of `\Delta`.

        OUTPUT:

        - :class:`anticanonical hypersurface <AnticanonicalHypersurface>` of
          ``self`` (with the extended base field, if necessary).

        EXAMPLES:

        We realize the projective plane as a Fano toric variety::

            sage: simplex = lattice_polytope.projective_space(2)
            sage: P2 = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta_polar=simplex)

        Its anticanonical "hypersurface" is a one-dimensional Calabi-Yau
        manifold::

            sage: P2.anticanonical_hypersurface(
            ...         monomial_points="all")
            Closed subscheme of 2-d CPR-Fano toric variety
            covered by 3 affine patches defined by:
              a0*z0^3 + a9*z0^2*z1 + a7*z0*z1^2
            + a1*z1^3 + a8*z0^2*z2 + a6*z0*z1*z2
            + a4*z1^2*z2 + a5*z0*z2^2
            + a3*z1*z2^2 + a2*z2^3

        In many cases it is sufficient to work with the "simplified polynomial
        moduli space" of anticanonical hypersurfaces::

            sage: P2.anticanonical_hypersurface(
            ...         monomial_points="simplified")
            Closed subscheme of 2-d CPR-Fano toric variety
            covered by 3 affine patches defined by:
              a0*z0^3 + a1*z1^3 + a6*z0*z1*z2 + a2*z2^3

        The mirror family to these hypersurfaces lives inside the Fano toric
        variety obtained using ``simplex`` as ``Delta`` instead of
        ``Delta_polar``::

            sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta=simplex,
            ...         coordinate_points="all")
            sage: FTV.anticanonical_hypersurface(
            ...         monomial_points="simplified")
            Closed subscheme of 2-d CPR-Fano toric variety
            covered by 9 affine patches defined by:
              a2*z2^3*z3^2*z4*z5^2*z8
            + a1*z1^3*z3*z4^2*z7^2*z9
            + a3*z0*z1*z2*z3*z4*z5*z7*z8*z9
            + a0*z0^3*z5*z7*z8^2*z9^2

        Here we have taken the resolved version of the ambient space for the
        mirror family, but in fact we don't have to resolve singularities
        corresponding to the interior points of facets - they are singular
        points which do not lie on a generic anticanonical hypersurface::

            sage: FTV = CPRFanoToricVariety(Delta=simplex,
            ...         coordinate_points="all but facets")
            sage: FTV.anticanonical_hypersurface(
            ...         monomial_points="simplified")
            Closed subscheme of 2-d CPR-Fano toric variety
            covered by 3 affine patches defined by:
              a0*z0^3 + a1*z1^3 + a3*z0*z1*z2 + a2*z2^3

        This looks very similar to our second version of the anticanonical
        hypersurface of the projective plane, as expected, since all
        one-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds are elliptic curves!
