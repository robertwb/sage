    Returns the category of duals of objects of ``self``.

    INPUT:

     - ``self`` -- a subcategory of vector spaces over some base ring

    The dual of a vector space `V` is the space consisting of all
    linear functionals on `V` (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space).
    Additional structure on `V` can endow its dual with additional
    structure; e.g. if `V` is an algebra, then its dual is a
    coalgebra.

    This returns the category of dual of spaces in ``self`` endowed
    with the appropriate additional structure.

    See also
    :class:`~sage.categories.covariant_functorial_construction.CovariantFunctorialConstruction`.

    TODO: add support for graded duals.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: VectorSpaces(QQ).DualObjects()
        Category of duals of vector spaces over Rational Field

    The dual of a vector space is a vector space::

        sage: VectorSpaces(QQ).DualObjects().super_categories()
        [Category of vector spaces over Rational Field]

    The dual of an algebra space is a coalgebra::

        sage: Algebras(QQ).DualObjects().super_categories()
        [Category of coalgebras over Rational Field, Category of duals of vector spaces over Rational Field]

    The dual of a coalgebra space is an algebra::

        sage: Coalgebras(QQ).DualObjects().super_categories()
        [Category of algebras over Rational Field, Category of duals of vector spaces over Rational Field]

    As a shorthand, this category can be accessed with the
    :meth:`dual` method::

        sage: VectorSpaces(QQ).dual()
        Category of duals of vector spaces over Rational Field

    TESTS::

        sage: C = VectorSpaces(QQ).DualObjects()
        sage: C.base_category()
        Category of vector spaces over Rational Field
        sage: C.super_categories()
        [Category of vector spaces over Rational Field]
        sage: latex(C)
