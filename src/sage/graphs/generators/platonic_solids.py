def _circle_embedding(g, vertices, center=(0, 0), radius=1, shift=0):
    r"""
    Set some vertices on a circle in the embedding of a graph G.

    This method modifies the graph's embedding so that the vertices
    listed in ``vertices`` appear in this ordering on a circle of given
    radius and center. The ``shift`` parameter is actually a rotation of
    the circle. A value of ``shift=1`` will replace in the drawing the
    `i`-th element of the list by the `(i-1)`-th. Non-integer values are
    admissible, and a value of `\alpha` corresponds to a rotation of the
    circle by an angle of `\alpha 2\pi/n` (where `n` is the number of
    vertices set on the circle).

    EXAMPLE::

        sage: from sage.graphs.graph_generators import _circle_embedding
        sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(5)

def TetrahedralGraph(self):
    """
    Returns a tetrahedral graph (with 4 nodes).

    A tetrahedron is a 4-sided triangular pyramid. The tetrahedral
    graph corresponds to the connectivity of the vertices of the
    tetrahedron. This graph is equivalent to a wheel graph with 4 nodes
    and also a complete graph on four nodes. (See examples below).

    PLOTTING: The tetrahedral graph should be viewed in 3 dimensions.
    We chose to use the default spring-layout algorithm here, so that
    multiple iterations might yield a different point of reference for
    the user. We hope to add rotatable, 3-dimensional viewing in the
    future. In such a case, a string argument will be added to select
    the flat spring-layout over a future implementation.
