def RingedTree(self, k):
    r"""
    Return the ringed tree on k-levels.

    A ringed tree of level `k` is a fully binary tree with `k` levels (counting
    the root as a level), in which all vertices at the same level are connected
    by a ring. More precisely, we can use a binary string to represent each
    vertex in the tree, such that the root (at level 0) is represented by an
    empty string, and the left child and the right child of a vertex with string
    `\sigma` are represented as `\sigma0` and \sigma1`, respectively. Then, at
    each level `i = 1, 2, \cdots , k-1`, we connect two vertices `u` and `v`
    represented by binary strings `\sigma_u` and `\sigma_v` if `(\sigma_u + 1)
    \pmod{2^i}\equiv \sigma_v`, where the addition treats the binary strings as
    the integers they represent.

    INPUT:

    - ``k`` -- the number of levels of the ringed tree.

    EXAMPLE:

        sage: G = graphs.RingedTree(5)
        sage: P = G.plot(vertex_labels=False, vertex_size=10)
        sage: P.show() # long time

    TEST:

        sage: G = graphs.RingedTree(-1)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: The number of levels must be >= 1.

        raise ValueError('The number of levels must be >= 1.')
