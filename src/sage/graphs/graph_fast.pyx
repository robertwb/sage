    Graphs each component of G separately, placing them adjacent to
    each other. This is done because on a disconnected graph, the
    spring layout will push components further and further from each

    component.

    NOTE:
        If the axis are scaled to fit the plot in a square, the
        horizontal distance may end up being "squished" due to
        the several adjacent components.

    with springs, rather it is more a model of such things traveling,
    without any inertia, through an (ever thickening) fluid.

    TODO: The inertial model could be incorperated (with F=ma)
    TODO: Are the hard-coded constants here optimal?

    INPUT:
        iterations -- number of steps to take
        dim        -- number of dimensions of freedom
        pos        -- already initalized initial positions

                      These doubles are then placed consecutively in the array.
                      For example, if dim=3, we would have
