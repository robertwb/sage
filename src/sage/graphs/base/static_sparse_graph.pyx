Static Sparse Graphs

What is the point ?
-------------------

This class implements a Cython (di)graph structure made for efficiency. The
graphs are *static*, i.e. no add/remove vertex/edges methods are available, nor
can they easily or efficiently be implemented within this data structure.

The data structure, however, is made to save the maximum amount of computations
for graph algorithms whose main operation is to *list the out-neighbours of a
vertex* (which is precisely what BFS, DFS, distance computations and the
flow-related stuff waste their life on).

The code contained in this module is written C-style. While Sage needs a class
for static graphs (not available today, i.e. 2012-01-13) it is not what we try
to address here. The purpose is efficiency and simplicity.

Data structure
--------------

.. image:: ../../../media/structure.png

The data structure is actually pretty simple and compact. ``short_digraph`` has
three fields

    * ``n`` (``int``) -- the number of vertices in the graph.

    * ``edges`` (``unsigned short *``) -- array whose length is the number of
      edges of the graph.

    * ``neighbors`` (``unsigned short **``) -- this array has size `n+1`, and
      describes how the data of ``edges`` should be read : the neighbors of
      vertex `i` are the elements of ``edges`` addressed by
      ``neighbors[i]...neighbors[i+1]-1``. The element ``neighbors[n]``, which
      corresponds to no vertex (they are numbered from `0` to `n-1`) is present
      so that it remains easy to enumerate the neighbors of vertex `n-1` : the
      last of them is the element addressed by ``neighbors[n]-1``.


In the example given above, vertex 0 has 2,3,5,7,8 and 9 as out-neighbors, but
not 4, which is an out-neighbour of vertex 1. Vertex `n-1` has 2, 5, 8 and 9 as
out-neighbors. `\text{neighbors[n]}` points toward the cell immediately *after*
the end of `\text{edges}`, hence *outside of the allocated memory*. It is used
to indicate the end of the outneighbors of vertex `n-1`

**Iterating over the edges**

This is *the one thing* to have in mind when working with this data structure::

    cdef list_edges(short_digraph g):
        cdef ushort * v
        cdef ushort * end
        cdef int i

        for i in range(g.n):
            v = g.neighbors[i]
            end = g.neighbors[i+1]

            while v < end:
                print "There is an edge from "+str(i)+" to "+str(v[0])
                v += 1

**Advantages**

Three great points :

    * The neighbors of a vertex are contiguous in memory.
    * Going from one to the other amounts to increasing a pointer.
    * Storing such graphs is incredibly cheaper than storing Python structures.

Well, I think it would be hard to have anything more efficient than that to
enumerate out-neighbors in sparse graphs ! :-)

Technical details
-----------------

    * When creating a ``fast_digraph`` from a ``Graph`` or ``DiGraph`` named
      ``G``, the `i^{\text{th}}` vertex corresponds to ``G.vertices()[i]``

    * The data structure does not support edge labels

    * In its current implementation (with ``unsigned short`` variables), the
      data structure can handle graphs with at most 65535 vertices. If
      necessary, changing it to ``int`` is totally straightforward.

    * Some methods return ``bitset_t`` objets when lists could be
      expected. There is a very useful ``bitset_list`` function for this kind of
      problems :-)

    * The codes of this module are well documented, and many answers can be
      found directly in the code.

Todo list

    * Adjacency test. The data structure can support it efficiently through
      dichotomy. It would require to sort the list of edges as it is not done at
      the moment. Some calls to the C function ``qsort`` would be sufficient.

Cython functions
----------------

``init_short_digraph(short_digraph g, G)``

    This method initializes ``short_digraph g`` so that it represents ``G``. If
    ``G`` is a ``Graph`` objet (and not a ``DiGraph``), an edge between two
    vertices `u` and `v` is replaced by two arcs in both directions.

``int n_edges(short_digraph g)``

    Returns the number of edges in ``g``

``int out_degree(short_digraph g, int i)``

    Returns the out-degree of vertex `i` in ``g``

``init_empty_copy(short_digraph dst, short_digraph src)``

    Allocates memory for ``dst`` so that it can contain as many vertices and
    edges as ``src``. Its content is purely random, though.

``init_reverse(short_digraph dst, short_digraph src)``

    Initializes ``dst`` so that it represents a copy of ``src`` in which all
    edges go in the opposite direction.

``can_be_reached_from(short_digraph g, int src, bitset_t reached)``

    Assuming ``bitset_t reached`` has size at least ``g.n``, this method updates
    ``reached`` so that it represents the set of vertices that can be reached
    from ``src`` in ``g``.

``strongly_connected_component_containing_vertex(short_digraph g, short_digraph g_reversed, int v, bitset_t scc)``

    Assuming ``bitset_t reached`` has size at least ``g.n``, this method updates
    ``scc`` so that it represents the vertices of the strongly connected
    component containing ``v`` in ``g``. The variable ``g_reversed`` is assumed
    to represent the reverse of ``g``.

``free_short_digraph(short_digraph g)``

    Free the ressources used by ``g``

What is this module used for ?
------------------------------

At the moment, it is only used in the :mod:`sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs` module.

Python functions
----------------

These functions are available so that Python modules from Sage can call the
Cython routines this module implements (as they can not directly call methods
with C arguments).
