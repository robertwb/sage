Distances/shortest paths between all pairs of vertices

This module implements a few functions that deal with the computation of
distances or shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

**Efficiency** : Because these functions involve listing many times the
(out)-neighborhoods of (di)-graphs, it is useful in terms of efficiency to build
a temporary copy of the graph in a data structure that makes it easy to compute
quickly. These functions also work on large volume of data, typically dense
matrices of size `n^2`, and are expected to return corresponding dictionaries of
size `n^2`, where the integers corresponding to the vertices have first been
converted to the vertices' labels. Sadly, this last translating operation turns
out to be the most time-consuming, and for this reason it is also nice to have a
Cython module, and version of these functions that return C arrays, in order to
avoid these operations when they are not necessary.

**Memory cost** : The methods implemented in the current module sometimes need large
amounts of memory to return their result. Storing the distances between all
pairs of vertices in a graph on `1500` vertices as a dictionary of dictionaries
takes around 200MB, while storing the same information as a C array requires
4MB.


The module's main function
--------------------------

The C function ``all_pairs_shortest_path_BFS`` actually does all the
computations, and all the others (except for ``Floyd_Warshall``) are just
wrapping it. This function begins with copying the graph in a data structure
that makes it fast to query the out-neighbors of a vertex, then starts one
Breadth First Search per vertex of the (di)graph.

**What can this function compute ?**

    - The matrix of predecessors.

      This matrix `P` has size `n^2`, and is such that vertex `P[u,v]` is a
      predecessor of `v` on a shortest `uv`-path. Hence, this matrix efficiently
      encodes the information of a shortest `uv`-path for any `u,v\in G` :
      indeed, to go from `u` to `v` you should first find a shortest
      `uP[u,v]`-path, then jump from `P[u,v]` to `v` as it is one of its
      outneighbors. Apply recursively and find out what the whole path is !.

    - The matrix of distances.

      This matrix has size `n^2` and associates to any `uv` the distance from
      `u` to `v`.

    - The vector of eccentricities.

      This vector of size `n` encodes for each vertex `v` the distance to vertex
      which is furthest from `v` in the graph. In particular, the diameter of
      the graph is the maximum of these values.

**What does it take as input ?**

    - ``gg`` a (Di)Graph.

    - ``unsigned short * predecessors`` -- a pointer toward an array of size
      `n^2\cdot\text{sizeof(unsigned short)}`. Set to ``NULL`` if you do not
      want to compute the predecessors.

    - ``unsigned short * distances`` -- a pointer toward an array of size
      `n^2\cdot\text{sizeof(unsigned short)}`. The computation of the distances
      is necessary for the algorithm, so this value can **not** be set to
      ``NULL``.

    - ``unsigned short * eccentricity`` -- a pointer toward an array of size
      `n\cdot\text{sizeof(unsigned short)}`. Set to ``NULL`` if you do not want
      to compute the eccentricity.

**Technical details**


    - The vertices are encoded as `1, ..., n` as they appear in the ordering of
      ``G.vertices()``.

    - Because this function works on matrices whose size is quadratic compared
      to the number of vertices, it uses short variables to store the vertices'
      names instead of long ones to divide by 2 the size in memory. This means
      that the current implementation does not run on a graph of more than 65536
      nodes (this can be easily changed if necessary, but would require much
      more memory. It may be worth writing two versions). For information, the
      current version of the algorithm on a graph with `65536=2^{16}` nodes
      creates in memory `2` tables on `2^{32}` short elements (2bytes each), for
      a total of `2^{34}` bytes or `16` gigabytes.

    - In the C version of these functions, a value of ``<unsigned short> -1 =
      65535`` for a distance or a predecessor means respectively ``+Infinity``
      and ``None``. These case happens when the input is a disconnected graph,
      or a non-strongly-connected digraph.

    .. WARNING::

        The function ``all_pairs_shortest_path_BFS`` has **no reason** to be
        called by the user, even though he would be writing his code in Cython
        and look for efficiency. This module contains wrappers for this function
        that feed it with the good parameters. As the function is inlined, using
        those wrappers actually saves time as it should avoid testing the
        parameters again and again in the main function's body.

# Wiener index #

def wiener_index(G):
    r"""
    Returns the Wiener index of the graph.

    The Wiener index of a graph `G` can be defined in two equivalent
    ways [KRG96b]_ :

    - `W(G) = \frac 1 2 \sum_{u,v\in G} d(u,v)` where `d(u,v)` denotes the
      distance between vertices `u` and `v`.

    - Let `\Omega` be a set of `\frac {n(n-1)} 2` paths in `G` such that `\Omega`
      contains exactly one shortest `u-v` path for each set `\{u,v\}` of
      vertices in `G`. Besides, `\forall e\in E(G)`, let `\Omega(e)` denote the
      paths from `\Omega` containing `e`. We then have
      `W(G) = \sum_{e\in E(G)}|\Omega(e)|`.

    EXAMPLE:

    From [GYLL93c]_, cited in [KRG96b]_::

        sage: g=graphs.PathGraph(10)
        sage: w=lambda x: (x*(x*x -1)/6)

# Floyd-Warshall #

def floyd_warshall(gg, paths = True, distances = False):
    r"""
    Computes the shortest path/distances between all pairs of vertices.

    For more information on the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, see the `Wikipedia
    article on Floyd-Warshall
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm>`_.

    INPUT:

        - ``gg`` -- the graph on which to work.

        - ``paths`` (boolean) -- whether to return the dictionary of shortest
          paths. Set to ``True`` by default.

        - ``distances`` (boolean) -- whether to return the dictionary of
          distances. Set to ``False`` by default.

    OUTPUT:

        Depending on the input, this function return the dictionary of paths,
        the dictionary of distances, or a pair of dictionaries
        ``(distances, paths)`` where ``distance[u][v]`` denotes the distance of a
        shortest path from `u` to `v` and ``paths[u][v]`` denotes an inneighbor
        `w` of `v` such that `dist(u,v)= 1 + dist(u,w)`.

    .. WARNING::

        Because this function works on matrices whose size is quadratic compared
        to the number of vertices, it uses short variables instead of long ones
        to divide by 2 the size in memory. This means that the current
        implementation does not run on a graph of more than 65536 nodes (this
        can be easily changed if necessary, but would require much more
        memory. It may be worth writing two versions). For information, the
        current version of the algorithm on a graph with `65536=2^{16}` nodes
        creates in memory `2` tables on `2^{32}` short elements (2bytes each),
        for a total of `2^{34}` bytes or `16` gigabytes. Let us also remember
        that if the memory size is quadratic, the algorithm runs in cubic time.

    .. NOTE::

        When ``paths = False`` the algorithm saves roughly half of the memory as
        it does not have to maintain the matrix of predecessors. However,
        setting ``distances=False`` produces no such effect as the algorithm can
        not run without computing them. They will not be returned, but they will
        be stored while the method is running.

    EXAMPLES:

    Shortest paths in a small grid ::

        sage: g = graphs.Grid2dGraph(2,2)
        sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import floyd_warshall
        sage: print floyd_warshall(g)

        (1, 0): {(0, 1): (0, 0), (1, 0): None, (0, 0): (1, 0), (1, 1): (1, 0)},
        (0, 0): {(0, 1): (0, 0), (1, 0): (0, 0), (0, 0): None, (1, 1): (0, 1)},
        (1, 1): {(0, 1): (1, 1), (1, 0): (1, 1), (0, 0): (0, 1), (1, 1): None}}

    Checking the distances are correct ::

        sage: g = graphs.Grid2dGraph(5,5)
        sage: dist,path = floyd_warshall(g, distances = True)
        sage: all( dist[u][v] == g.distance(u,v) for u in g for v in g )
        True

    Checking a random path is valid ::

        sage: u,v = g.random_vertex(), g.random_vertex()
        sage: p = [v]
        sage: while p[0] != None:
        ...     p.insert(0,path[u][p[0]])
        sage: len(p) == dist[u][v] + 2
        True

    Distances for all pairs of vertices in a diamond::

        sage: g = graphs.DiamondGraph()
        sage: floyd_warshall(g, paths = False, distances = True)
        {0: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2},
         1: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1},
