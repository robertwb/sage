/* Types:

   TYPE_UNKNOWN - initial assignment

   Edge types: (assigned by depth first search; used throughout algorithms)

   EDGE_DFSCHILD - the arc is an edge to a DFS child; these are embedded first
                        as singleton bicomps.
   EDGE_FORWARD - back edge directed from DFS ancestor to descendant
   EDGE_BACK - DFS tree edge _or_ back edge directed from descendant to
                ancestor.  Embedder ignores these because the ancestors of a
                vertex are only embedded after the vertex.
   EDGE_DFSPARENT - If the arc (u,v) is of type EDGE_DFSCHILD, then the
                        twin arc (v,u) is marked with EDGE_DFSPARENT

   Vertex types: (used when searching paths of interest in a non-planar graph)

   VERTEX_HIGH_RXW - On the external face path between vertices R and X
   VERTEX_LOW_RXW  - X or on the external face path between vertices X and W
   VERTEX_HIGH_RYW - On the external face path between vertices R and Y
   VERTEX_LOW_RYW  - Y or on the external face path between vertices Y and W

/* Data members needed by vertices and edges

   Vertices
        v: Carries original vertex number (same as array index)
                DFSNumber then uses it to store DFI.
                SortVertices then restores original vertex numbers when vertices
                are put in DFI order (i.e. not same as array index)
        visited: helps detect vertex visitation during various algorithms
                such as Walkup
        link: array indices that 'point' to the start and end arcs of the adjacency list
        type: Used by Kuratowski subgraph isolator to classify vertices when
                searching for certain paths in a biconnected component.
        flags: Lowest 16 bits a reserved for future expansion of the library.
               Next higher 16 bits can be safely used by consuming applications.
               Currently, no flag bits are used for vertices.

   Edges
        v: The edge record for (u,v) will be in u's list and store the index of
                the neighbour v. Starts out being original vertex number, but
                SortVertices renumbers to DFI so we get constant time access.
        visited: helps detect edge visitation, e.g. during the initial depth
                        first search, during a face reading, and during
                        Kuratowski subgraph isolation
        link: Linkages to other edges in an adjacency list.
        type: Used by DFSNumber to classify edges as DFSCHILD, DFSPARENT,
                FORWARD, BACK. See macro definitions above.
        flags: Lowest 16 bits a reserved for future expansion of the library.
               Next higher 16 bits can be safely used by consuming applications.
               The library uses bits 0 and 1 to indicate the INONLY and OUTONLY
               arcs of a directed edge.
               The planar embedder uses bit 2 on a DFSCHILD edge record of the
               root edge of a bicomp to indicate inverted orientation.

/* Data members needed by vertices

        leastAncestor: min(DFI of neighbors connected by backedge)
        Lowpoint: min(leastAncestor, min(Lowpoint of DFS Children))
        adjacentTo: Used by the embedder; during walk-up, each vertex that is
                directly adjacent via a back edge to the vertex currently
                being embedded will have the forward edge's index stored in
                this field.  During walkdown, each vertex whose AdjacentTo
                field is set will cause a back edge to be embedded.
        pertinentBicompList: used by Walkup to store a list of child bicomps of
                a vertex descendant of the current vertex that are pertinent
                and must be merged by the Walkdown in order to embed the cycle
                edges of the current vertex.  In this implementation,
                externally active pertinent child bicomps are placed at the end
                of the list as an easy way to make sure all internally active
                bicomps are processed first.
        separatedDFSChildList: contains list DFS children of this vertex in
                non-descending order by Lowpoint (sorted in linear time).
                When merging bicomp rooted by edge (r, c) into vertex v (i.e.
                merging root copy r with parent copy v), the vertex c is
                removed from the separatedDFSChildList of v.
                A vertex's status-- inactive, internally active, externally
                active-- is determined by the lesser of its leastAncestor and
                the least lowpoint from among only those DFS children that
                aren't in the same bicomp with the vertex.
        fwdArcList: at the start of embedding, the back edges from a vertex
                to its DFS descendants are separated from the main adjacency
                list and placed in a circular list until they are embedded.
                This member indicates a node in that list.

 PERTINENT()
 A vertex is pertinent in a partially processed graph if there is an
 unprocessed back edge between the vertex I whose edges are currently
 being processed and either the vertex or a DFS descendant D of the
 vertex not in the same bicomp as the vertex.

 The vertex is either directly adjacent to I by an unembedded back edge
 or there is an unembedded back edge (I, D) and the vertex is a cut
 vertex in the partially processed graph along the DFS tree path from
 D to I.

 Pertinence is a dynamic property that can change for a vertex after
 each edge addition.  In other words, a vertex can become non-pertinent
 during step I as more back edges to I are embedded.

 FUTUREPERTINENT()
 A vertex is future-pertinent in a partially processed graph if
 there is an unprocessed back edge between a DFS ancestor A of the
 vertex I whose edges are currently being processed and either the
 vertex or a DFS descendant D of the vertex not in the same bicomp
 as the vertex.

 The vertex is either directly adjacent to A by an unembedded back edge
 or there is an unembedded back edge (A, D) and the vertex is a cut
 vertex in the partially processed graph along the DFS tree path from
 D to A.

 If no more edges are added to the partially processed graph prior to
 processing the edges of A, then the vertex would be pertinent.
 The addition of edges to the partially processed graph can alter
 both the pertinence and future pertinence of a vertex.  For example,
 if the vertex is pertinent due to an unprocessed back edge (I, D1) and
 future pertinent due to an unprocessed back edge (A, D2), then the
 vertex may lose both its pertinence and future pertinence when edge
 (I, D1) is added if D2 is equal to or an ancestor of D1.

 Generally, pertinence and future pertinence are dynamic properties
 that can change for a vertex after each edge addition.

/********************************************************************
 EXTERNALLYACTIVE()
 Tells whether a vertex is still externally active in step I.
 A vertex can become inactive during step I as edges are embedded.

 In planarity-related algorithms, external activity is the same as
 future pertinence.  A vertex must be kept on the external face of
 the partial embedding until its pertinence and future pertinence
 are resolved through edge additions.

 For outerplanarity-related algorithms, all vertices are always
 externally active, since they must always remain on the external face.
