 gp_SortVertices()
 Once depth first numbering has been applied to the graph, the v member
 of each vertex contains the DFI.  This routine can reorder the vertices
 in linear time so that they appear in ascending order by DFI.  Note
 that the field v is then used to store the original number of the
 vertex.
 Note that this function is not underscored (i.e. not private).  We
 export it because it can be called again at a later point to reorder
 the vertices back into the original numbering with the DFI values
 stored in the v fields (in other words this function is its own inverse).

 gp_LowpointAndLeastAncestor()
        leastAncestor: min(DFI of neighbors connected by backedge)
        Lowpoint: min(leastAncestor, Lowpoint of DFSChildren)

 This implementation requires that the vertices be sorted in DFI order
 (such that the edge records contain DFI values in their v fields).  An
 implementation could be made to run before sorting using the fact that
 the value G[G[e].v].v before sorting is equal to G[e].v after the sort.

 For computing Lowpoint, we must do a post-order traversal of the DFS tree.
 We push the root of the DFS tree, then we loop while the stack is not empty.
 We pop a vertex; if it is not marked, then we are on our way down the DFS
 tree, so we mark it and push it back on, followed by pushing its
 DFS children.  The next time we pop the node, all of its children
 will have been popped, marked+children pushed, and popped again.  On
 the second pop of the vertex, we can therefore compute the Lowpoint
 values based on the childrens' Lowpoints and the edges in the vertex's
 adjacency list.

 A stack of size N suffices because we push each vertex only once.
