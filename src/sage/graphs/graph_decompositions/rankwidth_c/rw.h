// This is a program that calculates rank-width and rank-decompositions. It is based on ideas from "Computing rank-width exactly" by Sang-il Oum, "Sopra una formula numerica" by Ernesto Pascal and "Generation of a Vector from the Lexicographical Index" by B.P. Buckles and M. Lybanon.
// On 2009's computers it works quite well up to graph sizes of about 28 nodes.
// It is an implementation of the trivial algorithm from "Computing rank-width exactly". For larger graphs (more than about 40 nodes) the more algorithm based on fast subset convolution from the same paper would probably be faster.

#include <stdint.h>

// Use data type uint_leastN_t. N is an upper limit on the size of the graphs that can be handled. N=32 seems to be a good compromise for now (the code works well with other values of N).
// uint_leastN_t is faster than uint_fastN_t here, since the bottleneck is cache misses.
