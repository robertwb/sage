class DiGraphGenerators():
    r"""
    A class consisting of constructors for several common digraphs,
    including orderly generation of isomorphism class representatives.

    A list of all graphs and graph structures in this database is
    available via tab completion. Type "digraphs." and then hit tab to
    see which graphs are available.

    The docstrings include educational information about each named
    digraph with the hopes that this class can be used as a reference.

    The constructors currently in this class include::

                Random Directed Graphs:
                    - RandomDirectedGN
                    - RandomDirectedGNC
                    - RandomDirectedGNR

                Families of Graphs:
                    - DeBruijn



    ORDERLY GENERATION: digraphs(vertices, property=lambda x: True,
    augment='edges', size=None)

    Accesses the generator of isomorphism class representatives.
    Iterates over distinct, exhaustive representatives.

    INPUT:


    -  ``vertices`` - natural number

    -  ``property`` - any property to be tested on digraphs
       before generation.

    -  ``augment`` - choices:

    -  ``'vertices'`` - augments by adding a vertex, and
       edges incident to that vertex. In this case, all digraphs on up to
       n=vertices are generated. If for any digraph G satisfying the
       property, every subgraph, obtained from G by deleting one vertex
       and only edges incident to that vertex, satisfies the property,
       then this will generate all digraphs with that property. If this
       does not hold, then all the digraphs generated will satisfy the
       property, but there will be some missing.

    -  ``'edges'`` - augments a fixed number of vertices by
       adding one edge In this case, all digraphs on exactly n=vertices
       are generated. If for any graph G satisfying the property, every
       subgraph, obtained from G by deleting one edge but not the vertices
       incident to that edge, satisfies the property, then this will
       generate all digraphs with that property. If this does not hold,
       then all the digraphs generated will satisfy the property, but
       there will be some missing.

    -  ``implementation`` - which underlying implementation to use (see DiGraph?)

    -  ``sparse`` - ignored if implementation is not ``c_graph``

    EXAMPLES: Print digraphs on 2 or less vertices.

    ::

        sage: for D in digraphs(2, augment='vertices'):
        ...    print D

        ...    print D

        Digraph on 3 vertices

    Generate all digraphs with 4 vertices and 3 edges.

    ::

        sage: len(list(L))
        13

    Generate all digraphs with 4 vertices and up to 3 edges.

    ::

        sage: L = list(digraphs(4, lambda G: G.size() <= 3))
        sage: len(L)
        20
        sage: graphs_list.show_graphs(L)  # long time

    Generate all digraphs with degree at most 2, up to 5 vertices.

    ::

        sage: property = lambda G: ( max([G.degree(v) for v in G] + [0]) <= 2 )
        sage: L = list(digraphs(5, property, augment='vertices'))
        sage: len(L)

        Accesses the generator of isomorphism class representatives.
        Iterates over distinct, exhaustive representatives.

        INPUT:


        -  ``vertices`` - natural number

        -  ``property`` - any property to be tested on digraphs
           before generation.

        -  ``augment`` - choices:

        -  ``'vertices'`` - augments by adding a vertex, and
           edges incident to that vertex. In this case, all digraphs on up to
           n=vertices are generated. If for any digraph G satisfying the
           property, every subgraph, obtained from G by deleting one vertex
           and only edges incident to that vertex, satisfies the property,
           then this will generate all digraphs with that property. If this
           does not hold, then all the digraphs generated will satisfy the
           property, but there will be some missing.

        -  ``'edges'`` - augments a fixed number of vertices by
           adding one edge In this case, all digraphs on exactly n=vertices
           are generated. If for any graph G satisfying the property, every
           subgraph, obtained from G by deleting one edge but not the vertices
           incident to that edge, satisfies the property, then this will
           generate all digraphs with that property. If this does not hold,
           then all the digraphs generated will satisfy the property, but
           there will be some missing.

        -  ``implementation`` - which underlying implementation to use (see DiGraph?)

        -  ``sparse`` - ignored if implementation is not ``c_graph``

        EXAMPLES: Print digraphs on 2 or less vertices.
