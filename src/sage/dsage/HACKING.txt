Here are some guidelines to follow when hacking on Distributed SAGE

1)  Naming conventions
    This one is kind of tricky because Distributed SAGE relies heavily on
    twisted and also on SAGE.  Both use different naming conventions.
    Twisted names methods likeThis while SAGE names them like_this.  I have
    come to the conclusion that Distributed SAGE will make a compromise.
    Any methods that will be accessible by the user through the console
    should follow the SAGE naming convention (undercase method names,
    spaces are written as underscores).  Any methods that are
    framework/supporting libraries should follow Twisted's naming
    convention.
