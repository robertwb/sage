Given a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle as an integer matrix, this routine finds a single solution.
"""

def sudoku(A):
    r"""
    Solve the 9x9 Sudoku puzzle contained in the matrix `A`.

    INPUT:

    - `A` - a 9x9 matrix with integer entries from 0, 1..9. A `0` indicates an empty square

    OUTPUT:

    matrix - a 9x9 matrix over ZZ containing the first solution found

    ALGORITHM:

    A solution is found by examining blank cells in turn, determining which symbols
    are in use in the corresponding row, column and 3x3 sub-grid, and then making
    recursive calls exhausting all possibilities at that blank cell.  Basically this
    is a depth-first search to the first solution, with pruning accomplished according
    to only the basic requirements of a legitimate completed Sudoku.

    EXAMPLES:

    ::

        sage: A = matrix(ZZ,9,[5,0,0, 0,8,0, 0,4,9, 0,0,0, 5,0,0, 0,3,0, 0,6,7, 3,0,0, 0,0,1,  1,5,0, 0,0,0, 0,0,0,  0,0,0, 2,0,8, 0,0,0,    0,0,0, 0,0,0, 0,1,8,     7,0,0, 0,0,4, 1,5,0,   0,3,0, 0,0,2, 0,0,0,  4,9,0, 0,5,0, 0,0,3])
        sage: A
        [5 0 0 0 8 0 0 4 9]
        [0 0 0 5 0 0 0 3 0]
        [0 6 7 3 0 0 0 0 1]
        [1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
        [0 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0]
        [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
        [7 0 0 0 0 4 1 5 0]
        [0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0]
        [4 9 0 0 5 0 0 0 3]
        sage: sudoku(A)
        [5 1 3 6 8 7 2 4 9]
        [8 4 9 5 2 1 6 3 7]
        [2 6 7 3 4 9 5 8 1]
        [1 5 8 4 6 3 9 7 2]
        [9 7 4 2 1 8 3 6 5]

        [6 3 5 1 7 2 8 9 4]
        [4 9 1 8 5 6 7 2 3]

    Now we perturb `A` slightly to make the `(3,5)` entry impossible to complete.

    Completes a Sudoku puzzle starting at (an empty) square in row `i` and column `j`

    INPUT:

    - `A` - a 9x9 matrix with integer entries from 0, 1..9

    - `i` - integer specifying row `i`

    - `j` - integer specifying column `j`

    OUTPUT:

    matrix - a 9x9 matrix over ZZ

           If square `(i,j)` is non-zero (not empty) then `A` is returned immediately

           If there is no way to complete the puzzle then None is returned

           Otherwise a recursive call is made, which will eventually return a (partial) solution or None

    NOTES:

    As a practical matter this should be called with `(i,j)` being the first
    empty square (in row-major order), though nothing prohibits starting at
    another square (empty or not), and possibly getting a partially complete
    square back as output.

    EXAMPLES:

    ::

    This puzzle has only 17 non-empty squares (hints) and has a unique solution.
    At this writing (2009/04/11) there are no known 16-hint Sudoku puzzles
    with a unique solution.  It is number 3000 in Gordon Royle's database of 17-hint
    uniquely-solvable puzzles [1].

    Here we just test finding a possible completion if
    we started midway through the bottom row.

    Now we perturb `B` to make the (8,7) square impossible to complete.
    And we start at an empty square a little further back up the matrix.
