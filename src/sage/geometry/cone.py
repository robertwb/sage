Convex rational polyhedral cones

This module was designed as a part of framework for toric varieties
(:mod:`~sage.schemes.generic.toric_variety`,
:mod:`~sage.schemes.generic.fano_toric_variety`). While the emphasis is on
strictly convex cones, non-strictly convex cones are supported as well. Work
with distinct lattices (in the sense of discrete subgroups spanning vector
spaces) is supported. The default lattice is :class:`ToricLattice
<sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>` `N` of the appropriate
dimension. The only case when you must specify lattice explicitly is creation
of a 0-dimensional cone, where dimension of the ambient space cannot be
guessed.

In addition to cones (:class:`ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone`), this module
provides the base class for cones and fans (:class:`IntegralRayCollection`)
and the function for computing Hasse diagrams of finite atomic and coatomic
lattices (in the sense of partially ordered sets where any two elements have
meet and joint) (:func:`hasse_diagram_from_incidences`).

  Volker Braun.

EXAMPLES:

Use :func:`Cone` to construct cones::

    sage: octant = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)])
    sage: halfspace = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (-1,-1,0), (0,0,1)])
    sage: positive_xy = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0)])
    sage: four_rays = Cone([(1,1,1), (1,-1,1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,1)])

For all of the cones above we have provided primitive generating rays, but in
fact this is not necessary - a cone can be constructed from any collection of
rays (from the same space, of course). If there are non-primitive (or even
non-integral) rays, they will be replaced with primitive ones. If there are
extra rays, they will be discarded. Of course, this means that :func:`Cone`
has to do some work before actually constructing the cone and sometimes it is
not desirable, if you know for sure that your input is already "good". In this
case you can use options ``check=False`` to force :func:`Cone` to use
exactly the directions that you have specified and ``normalize=False`` to
force it to use exactly the rays that you have specified. However, it is
better not to use these possibilities without necessity, since cones are
assumed to be represented by a minimal set of primitive generating rays.
See :func:`Cone` for further documentation on construction.

Once you have a cone, you can perform numerous operations on it. The most
important ones are, probably, ray accessing methods::

    sage: halfspace.rays()
    (N(0, 0, 1), N(1, 0, 0), N(-1, 0, 0), N(0, 1, 0), N(0, -1, 0))
    sage: halfspace.ray(2)
    N(-1, 0, 0)
    sage: halfspace.ray_matrix()
    [ 0  1 -1  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0  1 -1]
    [ 1  0  0  0  0]
    sage: halfspace.ray_set()
    frozenset([N(1, 0, 0), N(-1, 0, 0), N(0, 1, 0), N(0, 0, 1), N(0, -1, 0)])

If you want to do something with each ray of a cone, you can write ::

    sage: for ray in positive_xy: print ray
    N(1, 0, 0)
    N(0, 1, 0)

You can also get an iterator over only some selected rays::

    sage: for ray in halfspace.ray_iterator([1,2,1]): print ray
    N(1, 0, 0)
    N(-1, 0, 0)
    N(1, 0, 0)

There are two dimensions associated to each cone - the dimension of the
subspace spanned by the cone and the dimension of the space where it lives::

    sage: positive_xy.dim()
    2
    sage: positive_xy.lattice_dim()
    3

You also may be interested in this dimension::

    sage: dim(positive_xy.linear_subspace())
    0
    sage: dim(halfspace.linear_subspace())
    2

Or, perhaps, all you care about is whether it is zero or not::

    sage: positive_xy.is_strictly_convex()
    True
    sage: halfspace.is_strictly_convex()
    False

You can also perform these checks::

    sage: positive_xy.is_simplicial()
    True
    sage: four_rays.is_simplicial()
    False
    sage: positive_xy.is_smooth()
    True

You can work with subcones that form faces of other cones::

    sage: face = four_rays.faces(dim=2)[0]
    sage: face
    2-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone
    sage: face.rays()
    (N(1, 1, 1), N(1, -1, 1))
    sage: face.ambient_ray_indices()
    (0, 1)
    sage: four_rays.rays(face.ambient_ray_indices())
    (N(1, 1, 1), N(1, -1, 1))

If you need to know inclusion relations between faces, you can use ::

    sage: L = four_rays.face_lattice()
    sage: map(len, L.level_sets())
    [1, 4, 4, 1]
    sage: face = L.level_sets()[2][0]
    sage: face.element.rays()
    (N(1, 1, 1), N(1, -1, 1))
    sage: L.hasse_diagram().neighbors_in(face)
    [1-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone,
     1-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone]

.. WARNING::

    As you can see in the above example, the order of faces in level sets of
    the face lattice may differ from the order of faces returned by
    :meth:`~ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.faces`. While the first order is
    random, the latter one ensures that one-dimensional faces are listed in
    the same order as generating rays.

When all the functionality provided by cones is not enough, you may want to
check if you can do necessary things using lattice polytopes and polyhedra
corresponding to cones::

    sage: four_rays.lattice_polytope()
    A lattice polytope: 3-dimensional, 5 vertices.
    sage: four_rays.polyhedron()
    A 3-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as
    the convex hull of 1 vertex and 4 rays.

And of course you are always welcome to suggest new features that should be
added to cones!

def Cone(data, lattice=None, check=True, normalize=True):
    r"""
    Construct a (not necessarily strictly) convex rational polyhedral cone.

    INPUT:

    - ``data`` -- one of the following:
        * :class:`~sage.geometry.polyhedra.Polyhedron` object representing
          a valid cone;
        * list of rays. Each ray should be given as a list or a vector
          convertible to the rational extension of the given ``lattice``;

    - ``lattice`` -- :class:`ToricLattice
      <sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>`, `\ZZ^n`, or any
      other object that behaves like these. If not specified, an attempt will
      be made to determine an appropriate toric lattice automatically;

    - ``check`` -- by default the input data will be checked for correctness
      (e.g. that all rays have the same number of components) and generating
      rays will be constructed from ``data``. If you know that the input is
      a minimal set of generators of a valid cone, you may significantly
      (up to 100 times on simple input) decrease construction time using
      ``check=False`` option;

    - ``normalize`` -- you can further speed up construction using
      ``normalize=False`` option. In this case ``data`` must be a list of
      immutable primitive rays in ``lattice``. In general, you should not use
      this option, it is designed for code optimization and does not give as
      drastic improvement in speed as the previous one.

    OUTPUT:

    - convex rational polyhedral cone determined by ``data``.

    EXAMPLES:

    Let's define a cone corresponding to the first quadrant of the plane
    (note, you can even mix objects of different types to represent rays, as
    long as you let this function to perform all the checks and necessary
    conversions!)::

        sage: quadrant = Cone([(1,0), [0,1]])
        sage: quadrant
        2-dimensional cone
        sage: quadrant.rays()
        (N(1, 0), N(0, 1))

    You may prefer to use :meth:`~IntegralRayCollection.ray_matrix` when you
    want to take a look at rays, they will be given as columns::

        sage: quadrant.ray_matrix()
        [1 0]
        [0 1]

    If you give more rays than necessary, the extra ones will be discarded::

        sage: Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (0,1)]).rays()
        (N(1, 0), N(0, 1))

    However, this work is not done with ``check=False`` option, so use it
    carefully! ::

        sage: Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (0,1)], check=False).rays()
        (N(1, 0), N(0, 1), N(1, 1), N(0, 1))

    Even worse things can happen with ``normalize=False`` option::

        sage: Cone([(1,0), (0,1)], check=False, normalize=False)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'parent'

    You can construct different "not" cones: not full-dimensional, not
    strictly convex, not containing any rays::

        sage: one_dimensional_cone = Cone([(1,0)])
        sage: one_dimensional_cone.dim()
        1
        sage: half_plane = Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0)])
        sage: half_plane.rays()
        (N(0, 1), N(1, 0), N(-1, 0))
        sage: half_plane.is_strictly_convex()
        False
        sage: origin = Cone([(0,0)])
        sage: origin.rays()
        ()
        sage: origin.dim()
        0
        sage: origin.lattice_dim()
        2

    You may construct the cone above without giving any rays, but in this case
    you must provide lattice explicitly::

        sage: origin = Cone([])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: lattice must be given explicitly if there are no rays!
        sage: origin = Cone([], lattice=ToricLattice(2))
        sage: origin.dim()
        0
        sage: origin.lattice_dim()
        2
        sage: origin.lattice()
        2-dimensional lattice N

    Of course, you can also provide lattice in other cases::

        sage: L = ToricLattice(3, "L")
        sage: c1 = Cone([(1,0,0),(1,1,1)], lattice=L)
        sage: c1.rays()
        (L(1, 0, 0), L(1, 1, 1))

    Or you can construct cones from rays of a particular lattice::

        sage: ray1 = L(1,0,0)
        sage: ray2 = L(1,1,1)
        sage: c2 = Cone([ray1, ray2])
        sage: c2.rays()
        (L(1, 0, 0), L(1, 1, 1))
        sage: c1 == c2
        True

    When the cone in question is not strictly convex, the standard form for
    the "generating rays" of the linear subspace is "basis vectors and their
    negatives", as in the following example::

        sage: plane = Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (-1,-1)])
        sage: plane.ray_matrix()
        [ 1 -1  0  0]

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: octant = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)])
            sage: octant.adjacent()
            ()

            2
            sage: one_face.adjacent()[1]
            1-dimensional face of 3-dimensional cone

        Things are a little bit subtle with fans, as we illustrate below.

        First, we create a fan from two cones in the plane::

            sage: fan = Fan(cones=[(0,1), (1,2)],
            ...             rays=[(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0)])
            sage: cone = fan.generating_cone(0)
            sage: len(cone.adjacent())
            1

        The second generating cone is adjacent to this one. Now we create the
        same fan, but embedded into the 3-dimensional space::

            sage: fan = Fan(cones=[(0,1), (1,2)],
            ...             rays=[(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (-1,0,0)])
            sage: cone = fan.generating_cone(0)
            sage: len(cone.adjacent())
            1

        The result is as before, since we still have::

            sage: fan.dim()
            2

        Now we add another cone to make the fan 3-dimensional::

            sage: fan = Fan(cones=[(0,1), (1,2), (3,)],
            ...             rays=[(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (-1,0,0), (0,0,1)])
            sage: cone = fan.generating_cone(0)
            sage: len(cone.adjacent())
            0

        Since now ``cone`` has smaller dimension than ``fan``, it and its
        adjacent cones must be facets of a bigger one, but since ``cone``
        in this example is generating, it is not contained in any other.

        - :class:`finite poset <sage.combinat.posets.posets.FinitePoset>` of
          :class:`cones <ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>`.

        EXAMPLES:

        Let's take a look at the face lattice of the first quadrant::

            sage: quadrant = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)])
            sage: L = quadrant.face_lattice()
            sage: L
            Finite poset containing 4 elements

        To see all faces arranged by dimension, you can do this::

            sage: for level in L.level_sets(): print level
            [0-dimensional face of 2-dimensional cone]
            [1-dimensional face of 2-dimensional cone,
             1-dimensional face of 2-dimensional cone]
            [2-dimensional cone]

        To work with a particular face of a particular dimension it is not
        enough to do just ::

            sage: face = L.level_sets()[1][0]
            sage: face
            1-dimensional face of 2-dimensional cone
            sage: face.rays()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            AttributeError: 'PosetElement' object has no attribute 'rays'

        To get the actual face you need one more step::

            sage: face = face.element

        Now you can look at the actual rays of this face... ::

            sage: face.rays()
            (N(1, 0),)

        ... or you can see indices of the rays of the orginal cone that
        correspond to the above ray::

            sage: face.ambient_ray_indices()
            (0,)
            sage: quadrant.ray(0)
            N(1, 0)

        An alternative to extracting faces from the face lattice is to use
        :meth:`faces` method::

            sage: face is quadrant.faces(dim=1)[0]
            True

        The advantage of working with the face lattice directly is that you
        can (relatively easily) get faces that are related to the given one::

            sage: face = L.level_sets()[1][0]
            sage: D = L.hasse_diagram()
            sage: D.neighbors(face)
            [0-dimensional face of 2-dimensional cone,
             2-dimensional cone]

        However, you can achieve some of this functionality using
        :meth:`facets`, :meth:`facet_of`, and :meth:`adjacent` methods::

            sage: face = quadrant.faces(1)[0]
            sage: face
            1-dimensional face of 2-dimensional cone
            sage: face.rays()
            (N(1, 0),)
            sage: face.facets()
            (0-dimensional face of 2-dimensional cone,)
            sage: face.facet_of()
            (2-dimensional cone,)
            sage: face.adjacent()
            (1-dimensional face of 2-dimensional cone,)
            sage: face.adjacent()[0].rays()
            (N(0, 1),)

        Note that if ``cone`` is a face of ``supercone``, then the face
        lattice of ``cone`` consists of (appropriate) faces of ``supercone``::

            sage: supercone = Cone([(1,2,3,4), (5,6,7,8),
            ...                     (1,2,4,8), (1,3,9,7)])
            sage: supercone.face_lattice()
            Finite poset containing 16 elements
            sage: supercone.face_lattice().top()
            4-dimensional cone
            sage: cone = supercone.facets()[0]

    r"""
    Compute the Hasse diagram of an atomic and coatomic lattice.

    INPUT:

    - ``atom_to_coatoms`` - list, ``atom_to_coatom[i]`` should list all
      coatoms over the ``i``-th atom;

    - ``coatom_to_atoms`` - list, ``coatom_to_atom[i]`` should list all
      atoms under the ``i``-th coatom;

    - ``face_constructor`` - function or class taking as the first two
      arguments sorted :class:`tuple` of integers and any keyword arguments.
      It will be called to construct a face over atoms passed as the first
      argument and under coatoms passed as the second argument. Default
      implementation will just return these two tuples as a tuple;

    - all other keyword arguments will be passed to ``face_constructor`` on
      each call.

    OUTPUT:

    - :class:`finite poset <sage.combinat.posets.posets.FinitePoset>` with
      elements constructed by ``face_constructor``.

    .. NOTE::

        In addition to the specified partial order, finite posets in Sage have
        internal total linear order of elements which extends the partial one.
        This function will try to make this internal order to start with the
        bottom and atoms in the order corresponding to ``atom_to_coatoms`` and
        to finish with coatoms in the order corresponding to
        ``coatom_to_atoms`` and the top. This may not be possible if atoms and
        coatoms are the same, in which case the preference is given to the
        first list.

    ALGORITHM:

    The detailed description of the used algorithm is given in [KP2002]_.

    The code of this function follows the pseudo-code description in the
    section 2.5 of the paper, although it is mostly based on frozen sets
    instead of sorted lists - this makes the implementation easier and should
    not cost a big performance penalty. (If one wants to make this function
    faster, it should be probably written in Cython.)

    While the title of the paper mentions only polytopes, the algorithm (and
    the implementation provided here) is applicable to any atomic and coatomic
    lattice if both incidences are given, see Section 3.4.

    In particular, this function can be used for strictly convex cones and
    complete fans.

    EXAMPLES:

    Let's construct the Hasse diagram of a lattice of subsets of {0, 1, 2}.
    Our atoms are {0}, {1}, and {2}, while our coatoms are {0,1}, {0,2}, and
    {1,2}. Then incidences are ::

        sage: atom_to_coatoms = [(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)]
        sage: coatom_to_atoms = [(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)]

    and we can compute the Hasse diagram as ::

        sage: L = sage.geometry.cone.hasse_diagram_from_incidences(
        ...                       atom_to_coatoms, coatom_to_atoms)
        sage: L
        Finite poset containing 8 elements
        sage: for level in L.level_sets(): print level
        [((), (0, 1, 2))]
        [((0,), (0, 1)), ((1,), (0, 2)), ((2,), (1, 2))]
        [((0, 1), (0,)), ((0, 2), (1,)), ((1, 2), (2,))]
        [((0, 1, 2), ())]
