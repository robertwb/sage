Toric lattice elements

This module was designed as a part of the framework for toric varieties
(:mod:`~sage.schemes.generic.toric_variety`,
:mod:`~sage.schemes.generic.fano_toric_variety`).

AUTHORS:

- Andrey Novoseltsev (2010-05-27): initial version.

TESTS:

Let's create some lattices first::

    sage: N = ToricLattice(3)
    sage: M = N.dual()

Now we are ready to create elements of toric lattices::

    sage: n = N([1,2,3])
    sage: n
    N(1, 2, 3)
    sage: m = M(1,2,3)
    sage: m
    M(1, 2, 3)

Dual lattices can act on each other::

    sage: n * m
    14
    sage: m * n
    14

You can also add elements of the same lattice or scale them::

    sage: 2 * n
    N(2, 4, 6)
    sage: n * 2
    N(2, 4, 6)
    sage: n + n
    N(2, 4, 6)

However, you cannot "mix wrong lattices" in your expressions::

    sage: n + m
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+':
    '3-d lattice N' and '3-d lattice M'
    sage: n * n
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: elements of the same toric lattice cannot be multiplied!
    sage: n == m
    False

Note that ``n`` and ``m`` are not equal to each other even though they are
both "just (1,2,3)." Moreover, you cannot easily convert elements between
toric lattices::

    sage: M(n)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: N(1, 2, 3) cannot be converted to 3-d lattice M!

If you really need to consider elements of one lattice as elements of another,
you can either use intermediate conversion to "just a vector"::

    sage: ZZ3 = ZZ^3
    sage: n_in_M = M(ZZ3(n))
    sage: n_in_M
    M(1, 2, 3)
    sage: n == n_in_M
    False
    sage: n_in_M == m
    True

Or you can create a homomorphism from one lattice to any other::

    sage: h = N.hom(identity_matrix(3), M)
    sage: h(n)
    M(1, 2, 3)
