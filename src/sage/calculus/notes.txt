I had in mind the following iterative approach:

  (1) Implement the basic limit formulas for products, sums, quotients, etc.,
        in Python.
  (2) This reduces computing limits of symbolic expressions to computing
        the limits of the leaves in the tree, i.e., symbolic variables, constants, and
        primitive functions (like sinh, exp, log, erf).
 (3)  Limits of symbolic variables and constants are trivial.
 (4) For some special functions one writes an optional method _limit_
       that computes the limit of that special function at a point from a given
       direction.  The default _limit_ method in the base class computes the
       limit using maxima.  So for each function for which you want better
       speed or a different behavior from maxima, you just fill in the _limit_ method.

Exactly the steps above would also work for symbolic differentiation.
(Integration is a completely different story.)
