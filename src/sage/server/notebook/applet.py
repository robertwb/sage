# This file is part of the OLD Sage notebook and is NOT actively developed,

# moved to the separate Sage Notebook project:

# http://nb.sagemath.org/
#
# The new notebook is installed in Sage as an spkg (e.g., sagenb-0.3.spkg).

# Please visit the project's home page for more information, including directions on
