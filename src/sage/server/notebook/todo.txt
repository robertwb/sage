[] support for .sage/init.sage

[] print -- javascript button, which displays the whole page as one page
   (no scrolling, etc.), etc., and calls print.

[] latex -- support for embedding in output?, e.g.,
        view(x)
   embeds latex repn.

[] HTML cells in addition to SAGE code cells; or just better typesetting
   support and way to hide the input (!)

[] Scripts: way to load/attach via web interface.

[] Workbooks:
    (all html downloaded at once; so switching done entirely in js)
     -- new
     -- switching
     -- deleting

IDEAS:

[] os.sytem('pydoc -k <...>')  -- interesting

[] debugger -- some way to enter pdb and use it from web interface

[] when eval: always insert a new cell after the current one???
     mathematica does *not* do this, but word processors do.


OLD TODO:
   [] restart (with confirm) button -- lets you restart the
      client SAGE interpreter that is being run by the web server.
      This way you don't have to keep restarting the web server
      when doing code development.  Have button that can also
      save session, restart, and load session!
(not needed)
   [] ability to select any subset of the cells, e.g., by
      checking on a button next to each or something and do
      each of the following ops:
          delete them
          export them as another workbook
      Also, should be able to insert a workbook between two cells.
      Basically, copy, paste, and delete with bits of workbooks.
      Should also be able to reorganize them.
(not really needed)
   [x] way to time how long a computation takes.
   [x] word wrap -- default on, but toggle on/off on a cell-by-cell basis
      (will require ajax to do the wrapped/non-wrapped computation, or
      store both versions in the html... so will work offline)
   [x] input one form shouldn't delete data from any other forms;
       e.g., you could be editing one form and submit another!
   [x] The whole interface needs to be slimmed down so bunches of single
      line input (and output) will work.
   [] Ability to switch from one log (=workbook) to another via
      the web interface.
   [] Add text annotation that is not evaluated
      between blocks (maybe in html?)
   [] Ability to interrupt running calculations directly
      from the web interface (no console access)
   [] Nice animation while a computation is proceeding.
   [] Some way to show output as it is computed.
   [] Option to delete blocks
   [] Make block expand if enter a lot of text into it.
   [] Evaluate the entire worksheet
   [] Theme-able / skin-able
   [] Downloading and access to exact log of IO to client SAGE process
   [] Saving and loading of all objects in a session
   [] Save session objects as to log objects so don't have to re-eval?
   [] The entire page is resent/updated every time you hit shift-enter;
      using 'AJAX' this flicker/lag could be completely eliminated.
   [] When pressing shift-enter a line feed is inserted temporarily
      into the inbox, which is unnerving.
   [] Add authentication
   [] Embed the log object in the html file, so server session
      can be restared directly using the html file!  E.g., embed
      pickled Log object in a comment at end of the .html file.
   [] Ability to upload and download source files (to be run)
      via web interface; maybe ability to edit them too, via some
      'rich' code editing javascript 'widget'.
   [] rewrite tables using CSS
   [] load and attaching scripts.
   [] a way to interactively watch the output of a running computation
      (in verbose mode).
   [] undo -- have infinite undo and redo of the SAGE *log*, i.e.,
      text I/O (and possibly graphics).  does not save *state* of
      the "sage kernel".
   [] switch into mode where the whole input box is parsed by
      another system, e.g., Maxima.

DONE
   [x] Saving and loading of individual objects: -- should be trivial,
       but is very tedious right now.
       (maybe all relative paths for save/load should be redirected
        to sage_server directory?!)
   [x] The "move to the current input box" javascript *only* works
      with firefox (not opera, not konqueror); also this should
      just keep the page position where it is rather than move it.
      Moving to a more AJAX-ish model would alternatively fix this, maybe.
   [x] A. Clemesha: shrink/expand input/output blocks
   [x] A. Clemesha: When hit shift-enter the next text box should be made
      into focus.
   [x] Embedded graphics from plots;
       also embed png from latexing of math objects (so they look nice).


DONE:
[x] Manipulating cell list:
     -- add new cell (automatic at end)
     -- add cell between two existing cells
     -- delete cell

[x] Saved objects:
     -- info: load/save

[x] SAGE restart (with confirmation alert)

[x] interrupt -- should add (interrupted) to top of all output

[x] interrupt -- red only when comp running!!

[x] Fix worksheet area so it doesn't scroll horizontally

[x] Separate the variables / scripts panes from the workbooks / objects panes.

[x] Variables:
     -- info:
     -- change typeface of "type" of variable, e.g., in parens and dimmer,
        but variable name in bold.

[x] Introspection:
      Tab completion / search / help -- bring in from before.
