Final todo push for 2.9.2:

  * axes labels (but don't break tachyon!)
  * more doctests
  * the following commands:
       - parametric_plot3d
       - list_plot3d: implement algorithm from plane.
       - line3d
       - frame3d
       - plot3d
       - text3d
       - arrow
       - torus

       - sphere

       - tetrahedron
       - cube
       - octahedron
       - dodecahedron
       - icosahedron

 * make sure rgbcolor, color, opacity, rainbow work for all plots

 * make sure options to plot commands get passed through to show

 * clean up all doctests

=====================================================================

General TODO:
  * Make it so all extra parameters to any ploting commands (in 2d or 3d)
    are saved and passed through to show -- or at least those that
    are relevant, e.g., xmin, xmax, etc.
  * Fix all doctests now that show is not needed by default.
  * aspect_ratio for 2d plots.

Jmol bugs:

 * reloading a worksheet kills all jmol applets!  -- note if we get
   rid of jmolSetDocument(cell_writer) this doesn't happen; but then
   other things break.  Probably need to save the javascript and
   execute it each time we releoad.
 * Sphere(0.3,color="red").translate([1,1,-1]) has *holes* in it!!
 * (done) Default zoom is useless -- we will have to rescale the whole scene I think.
   Basically we have to figure out the true range of the 3d plot in each direction,
   then rescale everything into a 10x10x10 square.
   We should draw axis and allow for aspect ratios.
 * Invalid color doesn't yield an error message, e.g., Icosahedron(texture="yello")
 * color --> rgbcolor
 * In parametricsurface:
        except:       # TODO -- this would catch control-C,etc. -- FIX THIS TO CATCH WHAT IS RAISED!!!!
 * Observation:
      jmol embedded applets *crash* when more than 10 or so appear in
      a page... unless I make them all small (e.g. 50 pixels) in which
      case they DO NOT crash.

Jmol todo:

 * names should make sense (basically like in mathematica) and be lower case
     * for user exposed functions, (not necessarily for the classes)
 * Dynamic resizing in the notebook
 * Javascript controls in the notebook


Tachyon bugs:
 * Text3D doesn't work
