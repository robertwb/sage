Jmol bugs:

 * Sphere(0.3,color="red").translate([1,1,-1]) has *holes* in it!!
 * showing anything from the command line also pops up a "red window".
 * Text3d doesn't work at all
 * applet itself should be white
 * Default zoom is useless -- we will have to rescale the whole scene I think.
   Basically we have to figure out the true range of the 3d plot in each direction,
   then rescale everything into a 10x10x10 square.
   We should draw axis and allow for aspect ratios.

Jmol todo:

 * names should make sense (basically like in mathematica) and be lower case
 * Dynamic resizing in the notebook
 * Javascript controls in the notebook


Tachyon bugs:
