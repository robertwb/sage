  <p>The Sage server is currently starting.  Please wait.</p>
  <p> If the server is already running, feel free to
  <a href="http://localhost:8000/">access the notebook interface</a>
  at any time.</p>
  <p>When it has finished loading a page will be opened
  automatically.</p>
  <p>If you think you have waited long enough, then try <code>View
    Log</code> under the <code>Server</code> menu (or at the root of
    the menubar item's menu) which may give you some clues as to why
    it has not started.</p>
  <p>You may safely close this window at any time, or navigate to
    somewhere else.</p>
  <p>In the mean time terminal sessions should work normally.</p>
