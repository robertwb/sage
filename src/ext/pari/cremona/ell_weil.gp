/* Functions for computing Weil Pairing and related things
   -- mostly over an arbitrary ground field k, but at present we need
   to be able to generate random points on the curves which is only
   implemented for k=Z/pZ

\\ Two "dummy" functions, not needed as they shadow built-in functions
\\ elladd() and ellpow(), but included as templates for later versions to
\\ follow

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\ ellsum(e,t,s) returns s+t
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

{
ellsum(e,t,s)=elladd(e,s,t);
}

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\ ellmult(e,t,m) : recursive function for m>0
\\ returns m*t

if(m%2==0, return(mt));  \\ even m: return
mt=elladd(e,mt,t);    \\ odd m: add
mt
}

\\ in ell_ff.gp there are functions ellffsumpol(e,s,t) and
\\ ellffmultpol(e,s,t) with return [s+t,h] resp. [m*t,h] where
\\ h is in the function field and satisfies
\\
\\ div(h) = (s)+(t)-(s+t)-(0), resp.
\\ div(h) = m*(t)-(m*t)-(m-1)*(0).
\\
\\ In practice it is more efficient to do the following:  instead of
\\ constructing h and then evaluating it later, we evaluate as we go
\\ along.  For this to work we must only evaluate at a point (or divisor)
\\ whose support is disjoint from all points in the support of the
\\ functions arising in the contruction of h, which will (for the mult
\\ function) be some subset of the multiples of t of size of the order of
\\ log(m).
\\
\\ To achive this we first give version of the above which return as
\\ second component a Set of the x-coordinates of the points to be
\\ avoided, lift-ed in case the are of Mod() type.

\\ Now the evaluation versions.  We evaluate at a divisor of the form
\\ (s1)-(s2) : the functions in question are only defined up to a
\\ constant but this is well-defined
\\
\\ NB It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that none of the
\\ evaluation points are in the support of the partial functions
\\ evaluated!  See the function ellweilpairing() for an example
\\
\\ We use the function ellffaddpol() from ell_ff.gp
