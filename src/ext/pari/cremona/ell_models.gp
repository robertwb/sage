\\ Some functions for working with models of elliptic curves in GP \\

\\ For curves defined over Q these can test integrality locally or
\\ globally, and transform to an integral model by scaling (as in the
\\ static function ellintegralmodel() in elliptic.c); and test
\\ minimality locally or globally;  transforming to a minimal model is
\\ already provided in minimalmodel().

\\ In all the followign functions it is assumed that the elliptic
\\ curve e has rational coefficients (not necessarily integral) but we
\\ do not check this!

\\ In the functions which return a new model we would also like to
\\ return the transformation [u,0,0,0] used, as in the built-in function
\\ ellminimalmodel; but user-defined functions cannot have reference
\\ parameters :(  -- but for the future, we do compute the factor u such
\\ that output = ellchangecurve(e,[u,0,0,0])

\\ INTEGRALITY FUNCTIONS
\\

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\ Checking integrality:  cheats by using type-checking
\\ e is an ellinit structure of any length (5,13 or 19)
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

{
ellisintegral(e)=
prod(j=1,5,(type(e[j])=="t_INT"));
}

\\ Examples:
\\ ellisintegral([0,0,1,-7,6])
\\ returns 1 (true)
\\ ellisintegral(ellchangecurve(ellinit([0,0,1,-7,6]),[2,0,0,0]))
\\ returns 0 (false)
\\ ellisintegral(ellchangecurve(ellinit([0,0,1,-7,6]),[1/2,0,0,0]))
\\ returns 1 (true)

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\ Checking local integrality at a prime:
\\ e is an ellinit structure of any length (5,13 or 19),
\\ p should be a prime
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

{
ellislocallyintegral(e,p)=
prod(j=1,5,(valuation(e[j],p)>=0));
}

\\ Example:
\\ e = ellchangecurve(ellinit([0,0,1,-7,6]),[2,0,0,0]);
\\ (e.ai is [0, 0, 1/8, -7/16, 3/32])
\\ ellislocallyintegral(e,2)
\\ returns 0 (false)
\\ ellislocallyintegral(e,3)
\\ returns 1 (true)

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\ Making locally integral at a prime:
\\ e is an ellinit structure of any length (5,13 or 19),
\\ returns same length structure;
\\ p should be a prime
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

{
elllocalintegralmodel(e,p)=
local(ai,u);
u=p^vecmax(vector(5,k,-valuation(e[k],p)/if(k==5,6,k)));
ai=vector(5,k,e[k]*u^(if(k==5,6,k)));
if(#e==5,ai,ellinit(ai,#e==13));
}

\\ Example:
\\ e = ellchangecurve(ellinit([0,0,1,-7,6]),[6,0,0,0]).ai;
\\ returns [0, 0, 1/216, -7/1296, 1/7776]
\\ elllocalintegralmodel(e,2)
\\ returns [0, 0, 1/27, -7/81, 2/243]
\\ elllocalintegralmodel(e,3)
\\ returns [0, 0, 1/8, -7/16, 3/32]

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\ Making globally integral:
\\ e is an ellinit structure of any length (5,13 or 19)
\\ returns same length structure
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

\\ Method:  for each ai in turn and each p dividing denom(ai) we call
\\ the local version to scale up the short ai vector
\\
\\ To get the global u take the product of the local ones.

ellintegralmodel(e)=
local(ai,plist);

for(j=1,#plist,ai=elllocalintegralmodel(ai,plist[j])));
if(#e==5,ai,ellinit(ai,#e==13));
}

\\ Example:
\\ e = ellchangecurve(ellinit([0,0,1,-7,6]),[6,0,0,0]).ai;
\\ returns [0, 0, 1/216, -7/1296, 1/7776]
