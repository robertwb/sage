\\ Extension to built-in data type: the return vector from ellinit()
\\ on input of type t_INTMOD has length 19 but entries 14-19 are unused
\\ and set to 0.  We use these as follows (provisional):
\\
\\ E[14] : the group order n = #E(Fp)
\\ E[15] : factorization of the group order n
\\ E[16] : the group structure: [n] if cyclic, or
\\                              [n1,n2] with n=n1*n2 and n2|n1
\\ E[17] : the group generators: [P] is cyclic, or

\\

\\ Input can be either a vector of INT_MODs (in which case the
\\ parameter p is ignored so can be omitted) or a vector of INTs, in
\\ which case we need to also give the prime p.  No check is made that p
\\ is prime.  Singular data will cause a run-time error
\\
