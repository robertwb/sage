/*****************************************
          Memory management

NOTE -- before changing these away from Python's keep the following in
mind (from the Python C/API guide):

"In most situations, however, it is recommended to allocate memory from
the Python heap specifically because the latter is under control of
the Python memory manager. For example, this is required when the
interpreter is extended with new object types written in C. Another
reason for using the Python heap is the desire to inform the Python
memory manager about the memory needs of the extension module. Even
when the requested memory is used exclusively for internal,
highly-specific purposes, delegating all memory requests to the Python
memory manager causes the interpreter to have a more accurate image of
its memory footprint as a whole. Consequently, under certain
circumstances, the Python memory manager may or may not trigger
appropriate actions, like garbage collection, memory compaction or
other preventive procedures. Note that by using the C library
allocator as shown in the previous example, the allocated memory for
the I/O buffer escapes completely the Python memory manager."
