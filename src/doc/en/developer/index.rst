Welcome to the Sage Developer's Guide!
======================================

Sage is a free mathematics software system. It is implemented using
Python, Cython, and C++, together with various packages such as GAP,
GSL, Matplotlib, Maxima, MWRANK, NetworkX, NTL, Numpy, PARI, Singular
and many specialized systems and libraries. Sage is free and open
source, and is available under the terms of the GNU Public
License. Some parts are available under compatible licenses.

Everybody who uses Sage is encouraged to contribute something back to
Sage at some point. Implement a new function, add examples to the
documentation, find bugs and typos, fix a bug, create a new class,
create a fast new C library, etc. This book is a guide on how to
contribute to Sage.

This document describes how to write programs using Sage, how to
modify and extend the core Sage libraries, and how to modify Sage's
documentation. It also discusses how to share your new and modified
code with other Sage users.
