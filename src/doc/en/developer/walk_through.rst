=======================================
Walking Through the Development Process
=======================================

This section presents a general process for working on Sage. We will
walk through each step of the process, explaining specific steps and
commands to help you get started on developing Sage. Along the way,
other sources of information will be presented where you could find
more detailed information on some particular issue. If you are a
beginner to Sage development, this introductory guide is here to help
you become familiar with the Sage development process.


.. _section-modify-source:

Modifying Sage source code
--------------------------

The name ``SAGE_ROOT`` refers to the directory where Sage is
installed on your system, e.g. ``/sage/sage-4.1.2/``. Some people
install Sage under their home directory, in which case ``SAGE_ROOT``
would be something like ``/home/username/sage-4.3.1``. Software
packages that are shipped with Sage would then be located under
``/home/username/sage-4.3.1``. In other words, ``SAGE_ROOT`` is the
top-level directory of your Sage installation.

The majority of Sage code for development work is under
``SAGE_ROOT/devel``, where the symbolic link ``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage``
points to the current branch that you are using. The default branch is
the branch named ``sage-main`` and is also referred to as the main
branch. By default, the symbolic link ``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`` points
to ``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main``. Under each branch is a directory named
``sage``, which contains code for interfacing with third-party
packages and code that comprises the Sage library. You can think of
the directory ``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/sage`` (or
``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage``) as where the Sage library resides.

Suppose you have modified some part of the Sage library, e.g. add new
code or delete some code. How do you get Sage to know about your
changes? You need to rebuild the Sage library so that it is updated
with your changes. Navigate to ``SAGE_ROOT`` and rebuild the library
as follows::

    ./sage -b main

If ``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`` points to the main branch, you could use
the above command or more simply the following command

::

    ./sage -b

The switch ``-b`` is for (re)building the Sage library and the argument
``main`` is the branch you want to rebuild. In this case, you want to
rebuild the Sage library as contained in the main branch, i.e under
``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main``. In fact, the command ``./sage -b``
rebuilds whatever branch that the symbolic link
``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`` points to. Any of the above two commands does
not rebuild everything in the Sage library, but only those files in the
library that your changes affect. During the rebuild process, the
affected source files are copied elsewhere and compiled, Cython files
get converted to C code and compiled, and so on. Let this process
manage itself and do not edit the copies of the source files at their
destination.

You may want to create a totally distinct installation of Sage
compiled from source, where you will work so as to not impact a
version of Sage that you actually use. This could be true even if you
make clones (or sandboxes) as described in the next section.


.. _section-create-sandbox:

Creating a sandbox
------------------

With ``SAGE_ROOT`` as the default directory, you can create a new
branch (or clone) named ``test`` with the command::

    ./sage -clone test

Note that a general way to create a clone is the syntax
``./sage -clone <branch-name>``, where you should replace
``<branch-name>`` with the name you want to name your new
clone. Creating a clone may take a couple of minutes to conclude. The
result is a whole new subdirectory ``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-test`` where
the name ``sage-`` is automatically prepended to ``test``, and the
symbolic link ``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`` will now point to this new
subdirectory. Running Sage, or rebuilding, will use this version of
the source.

Now you can safely experiment with Sage code as much as you would
like. A cloned version of the Sage library can be found under

::

    SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-test/sage

The Sage library consists of Python files (with the file extension
``.py``) or Cython files (with extension ``.pyx``), organized into
subdirectories that mirror the module hierarchy reflected in the help
files, Python types, etc.  (With the ``sage`` symbolic link, you will
now see why sometimes you see directories that look like
```.../sage/sage/...``.)

Apart from the directory that holds the Sage library, another special
directory is

::

    SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-test/doc/en/reference

You can think of that directory as containing "table of contents"
files for documentation, each such file having the extension ``.rst``
to indicate that they follow the ReST format for documenting source
code.  Most documentation comes from the docstrings in the source
files. When you build the HTML or PDF versions of the reference
manual, the generated output lands in subdirectories of
``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-test/doc/output``.

To make another clone of the main branch, you need to first switch
back to the untouched code in the main branch.  From ``SAGE_ROOT``,
type

::

    ./sage -b main

to switch back to the original version, i.e. the main branch.  Now
make a new clone as shown above.

If a clone, say ``test``, is a mess and has nothing of value to you,
switch back to the main branch, then delete the directory
``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-test`` and everything below it. To know which
branch (or clone) you are using, issue the command

::

    ./sage -branch

This will report the current branch that the symbolic link
``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`` points to. Such information is also reported
by the command ``./sage`` when the current branch is not the main
branch.

There are many more arguments you can pass to Sage. For a list of
basic arguments, execute

::

    ./sage -help

The command

::

    ./sage -advanced


will report a list of advanced arguments in addition to the list of
basic arguments as output by ``./sage -help``.


.. _section-review-patch-walkthrough:

Reviewing a patch
-----------------

See also the section :ref:`section-review-patches` for further
guidelines on reviewing patches. Before reviewing a patch, you can
choose to download a patch file from the Trac server (the little
download icon next to the file name is the easiest way).  Clicking on
the file name will show you a side-by-side comparison view that is
useful for previewing changes; red shading is deletions, green shading
is additions.

To apply a patch to the code in your sandbox (see
:ref:`section-create-sandbox` for information on creating a sandbox),
follow these steps:

#. Run Sage: from ``SAGE_ROOT``, type ``./sage``.
#. Apply the patch: at the Sage command line, type::

       hg_sage.apply("<full-path-and-filename.patch>")

#. Quit Sage: use the command ``exit``.
#. Rebuild Sage: use the command ``./sage -b`` to rebuild the affected
   files in the Sage library.

In step 2, you are using Sage's simplified interface to the
`Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com>`_
revision control system.  This command will add the patch as a new
"changeset" and "commit" the changes.  At the Sage command line, you
can run ``hg_sage.log()`` to see before/after changes to the Sage
library. In step 4, you should only see a few files copied, modified,
etc.  Unaffected files should not be part of this step.  Look for
compilation errors in this output and modify your changes as
appropriate. Avoid producing patches that result in compilation
errors or errors in building the documentation. (You want a working
Sage installation, right?)

To actually test out a patch, do the following:

#. Experiment with the functionality proposed by the patch. Verify
   results are correct by hand computations, test bad input, outrageous
   situations, etc.
#. Run tests on the affected files. From ``SAGE_ROOT``, issue the
   command ``./sage -t devel/sage-test/path-to-directory-or-file`` to
   run doctests on the affected file(s). Failures should be reported
   on the ticket and are reason to move the ticket to "needs work".
#. If affected files pass tests, then run ``./sage -testall``. This
   will take a while to complete. No, it is not optional.  A reviewer
   or release manager could discover this step was skipped and request
   that you modify your patch to fix any resulting doctest failures.
#. Ensure that the documentation builds. From ``SAGE_ROOT``, run
   ``./sage -docbuild reference html``, which will build the HTML
   version of the documentation.  Check the "look" of affected files
   in the output directory for the documentation (see above).
#. Check for full doctest coverage. From ``SAGE_ROOT``, run
   ``./sage -coverage <file>``  which will provide a complete report.
   Less than 100% coverage is another reason to return a patch to
   "needs work" status.

For more information on doctesting the Sage library, see
:ref:`chapter-doctesting`.


Creating a change
-----------------

To make a change to Sage (fix a bug, add new functionality), proceed
as follows:

#. Make a fresh clone, as discussed in :ref:`section-create-sandbox`.
#. Apply any precursor patches not in your current version, as
   demonstrated in :ref:`section-review-patch-walkthrough`.
#. Edit source files (see :ref:`section-modify-source` for location),
   test building Sage, test functionality, and so on.
#. Once you have something you like, do everything suggested for
   reviewing a patch.  It is a waste of time for a reviewer to start
   on reviewing a patch and find that tests fail, documentation was
   not tested, etc.  It would save any reviewer a lot of time if your
   patches have been fully tested before you submit them for review.
   Everybody makes mistakes, everybody has bugs they did not
   anticipate, and everybody writes code that can be improved---that is
   why there are code reviews.  But do not cut corners.


.. _section-submitting-change:

Submitting a change
-------------------

Here is how to prepare a patch with your changes:

#. Register for a Trac account at the URL
   ``http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/register``. If you have
   problems with the registration process, please refer to the page
   ``http://www.sagemath.org/contact.html`` for the relevant person to
   contact about your registration issues. Most people use some
   variant of their real name, especially if they already have a
   reputation within mathematics.  Edit the main Trac page where there
   is a list of developers and add yourself with a link to your web
   page. Make sure to sort your Trac username alphabetically.
#. If it does not already exist, make a Trac ticket for your changes.
   Provide a one-line summary and then a description of the problem.
   Include a link to a sage-devel discussion if appropriate.  Choose a
   component, if this is a defect or enhancement, set your real name in
   the author field.  It works well if you have your Trac settings such
   that you get an email every time the ticket changes.  Make a note of
   the ticket number.
#. Create a ``.hgrc``  Mercurial configuration file in your home
   directory.  Specify your name and email address here, so it will
   identify you as the author of a patch, in the form `` Bill Smith
   <bsmith@bigu.edu>``. Here is a template for your ``.hgrc`` file:

   ::

       [ui]
       username = Carl Friedrich Gauss <cfgauss@uni-goettingen.de>

       [extensions]
       # Enable the Mercurial queue extension.
       hgext.mq =

   The Mercurial project website ``http://mercurial.selenic.com``
   contains many tutorials on using Mercurial.
#. If necessary, first switch to the branch holding your changes. From
   the Sage command line interface, run ``hg_sage.status()``.  The
   output will be a list of modified files, preceded by a capital ``M``.
   Check that this is what you expect.  For explanation of other
   letters, see the Mercurial documentation on the ``hg status``
   command.
#. From the Sage command line, run ``hg_sage.diff()``. This will show
   you the changes you have made. A plus sign is new code being added,
   a minus sign is code being deleted.  This should look like the
   changes you have made.
#. Now run ``hg_sage.commit()`` from the Sage command line.  This will
   package your changes as a single Mercurial "changeset", allowing
   others (reviewers, release manager) to add your changes to their
   versions of Sage.  An editor window will pop up (set your favorite
   editor in the ``.hgrc`` file mentioned above) where you should
   enter a *one-line* message describing the patch. This message is
   known as the commit message for your patch.  You are encouraged to
   write commit messages of the form
   ``Trac XXXX: <description-goes-here>`` using the Trac ticket number
   and then have a concise description, e.g. "fix echelon form error"
   or "add echelon form over finite fields." Some people also write
   commit messages in the form ``#xxxx: <description-goes-here>``,
   which is also acceptable. A key information to provide in a commit
   message is the ticket number.
#. Run the command ``hg_sage.log()`` from the Sage command line.  The
   first entry should be your changeset.  Note the changeset number,
   which is probably 5 decimal digits.
#. Next, issue the command

   ::

       hg_sage.export(<changeset-number>, "/path-to-somewhere/trac_XXXX_short_descriptor.patch")

   where ``short_descriptor`` is really short, like
   ``echelon_form_fix`` or at most ``finite_field_echelon_form``.
#. You can preview your patch using a "diff viewer". Some people use
   kompare on Linux, others use kdiff3.
#. Upload your patch to the Trac server.
#. Feel free to CC another developer (use their Trac username from the
   list on the main page) if you think they might be able to review your
   change.  If somebody else originated, or commented on the Trac ticket,
   they will be notified of your change if they have set Trac to email
   them of any changes.


Updating a change
-----------------

Your first patch would likely have a review that suggests
changes. Here is one way to update your patch.  (There is probably a
better way, but the following steps should be easy to follow.)

#. Make a new fresh clone.  Read :ref:`section-create-sandbox` to be
   sure you clone the right stuff (i.e. do not clone the branch you
   changed).  We will call this clone ``test2`` here.
#. Apply your patch, but not with ``hg_sage.apply()``.  You want to
   make the changes without doing a commit.  (There is a switch that
   will prevent a commit, but by doing this, you will see how to do
   this at the system level.)  First make
   ``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-test2/`` your working directory.  Then at
   the system command line, run::

       patch -p1 /path-to-somewhere/trac_XXXX_short_descriptor.patch

   which will be like you just edited the source files with all the
   changes from your original patch.  Now you can edit to reflect a
   reviewer's suggestions and prepare a new patch.
#. When you upload to Trac, you can replace the file with one of the
   same name. The comments will include an indication of when the
   upload happened, so nobody will be confused about when the
   replacement happened.


Being more efficient: Mercurial queues
---------------------------------------

Making a new clone for every review and for each revision to a
patch seems rather inefficient.  If you agree, then learn here
about Mercurial queues.  They use Sage's Mercurial repository for
tracking, collecting and organizing changes to Sage but are much
more flexible and fit better with the way a typical Sage
developer needs to work.  You will find them much more natural
and useful than repeatedly making clones and adjusting patches in
response to reviews.  And you don't need to learn anything about
Mercurial itself before you can begin.

In a nutshell, Mercurial queues are two stacks of patches (a
"patch" here means "a named collection of changes").  One stack
is a sequence of patches applied in the order in the stack. The
other stack is a set of patches that are "out of the way", but
still arranged in some order.  Simple commands then allow you to
move a patch off the top of one stack to the top of the other (in
either direction).

We will describe first how to get started, then three typical
activities will show how to use the basic commands. We then finish
with a "big picture" view, which you can read first if your mind works
that way.


Starting with Mercurial queues
------------------------------

You might find it most convenient to install a fresh copy of Sage
as your "development" version.  Instead of a version number for
the ``SAGE_ROOT`` directory you might name it something like
``dev``.  Since you will likely keep it constantly upgraded, a
version number will not make much sense.  Mine lives at
``/sage/dev`` with other copies right alongside in places like
``/sage/sage-4.3.1/``.

You also need to install a copy of Mercurial on your system,
since now you will not be using Sage's simplified interface.  So
use a package manager, or whatever, to install a recent
version. Alternatively, you could also use the version of Mercurial
that is shipped with Sage. To do so, from within your terminal window,
create an alias similar to the following::

    alias 'hg'='/path/to/SAGE_ROOT/sage -hg'

Afterwards, any time you execute the command ``hg`` in your terminal,
this would invoke the version of Mercurial that is installed with your
local Sage installation. However, once you quit or close your
terminal, the alias ``hg`` would be lost and would no longer point to
the Mercurial installation that comes with Sage.

You first need to "turn on" support for queues.  It is all
built-in by default but not visible.  Edit your ``~/.hgrc`` file
(in your home directory, where your user info is) and add the
following stanza if it is not present::

     [extensions]
     # Enable the Mercurial queue extension.
     hgext.mq =

The main Mercurial repository for the Sage library lives in
``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`` so you will interact with the repository
using this as the working directory.  This means to actually run
Sage, or rebuild it, you will use commands such as ``../../sage
-b``.  One time only, for each repository, you need to initialize
it for use with queues, so do the following::

    cd SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage
    hg qinit

HG is the symbol for the chemical element mercury, so ``hg`` is
the executable.  All the commands specific to queues begin with
the letter "q".  That's all the setup, you are ready to go.  The
command ``hg help mq`` will give a summary of queue commands. A
command like ``hg help qpop`` will give documentation for using the
``qpop`` command.


.. _section-review-patches-queues-walkthrough:

Reviewing patches with queues
-----------------------------

The two stacks used by queues are called "applied" and
"unapplied".  The names do a good job of describing the status
of the patches in each.  Download a patch from Trac as described
above (:ref:`section-review-patch-walkthrough`) in the usual way.
Then execute ::

    hg qimport <path-and-filename.patch>

This will add the patch to the top of your unapplied stack.  Use
``hg qunapplied`` to verify that the patch is in this stack.
Presumably you want to have the changes in this patch applied to
your Sage library, so use the simple command ``hg qpush`` to
accomplish this.  Now issue the command ``hg qapplied`` to see
the patch now present in the applied stack.  You can now rebuild
Sage, run the modified version, run tests, build documentation
and so on, as described above.

Let's suppose the patch you were reviewing was so bad Sage
wouldn't even build due to compiler errors.  So you have the time
to review something else.  Let's move the first patch out of the
way.  The command ``hg qpop`` will move the top patch in the
applied queue over to the top of the unapplied queue, so you
would be able to apply and review other patches.  Use ``hg qapplied``
and ``hg qunapplied`` to verify this movement.  Now download a new
patch, ``hg qimport`` it, and ``hg qpush`` to apply it.

Suppose this second patch turned out to be too far beyond your
expertise in a certain area of mathematics or programming.  Pop
it off the applied stack with ``hg qpop`` so it is now at the top
of the unapplied stack, sitting on top of the the un-compilable
patch (you haven't forgotten that one, have you?).  Use ::

    hg qdelete <patch-name>

to totally get rid of it.  Bye-bye. In the meantime, the author
of the first patch found the single little error that prevented
the patch from compiling and has posted a very small patch to
make the correction.  First, apply the original patch again with
``hg qpush``, then download the small patch with the fix, use
``hg qimport`` to get it onto the unapplied stack, then finally
``hg qpush`` to apply it on top of the buggy patch.  Now you
should be able to compile, experiment and test as usual with both
patches applied.

So we see you can use ``hg qimport`` and ``hg qdelete`` to move
patches in and out, ``hg qpop`` and ``hg qpush`` to move patches
between applied and unapplied states (stacks).  Keep track of
where you are with liberal use of ``hg qapplied`` and ``hg
qunapplied``.

You may be wondering what to do if your patches in the stacks end
up "out of order."  We'll cover that in a bit.


Creating your own patch with queues
-----------------------------------

Let's suppose you are ready to make some changes to the Sage
library of your own.  Put anything in the applied stack that you
need to build on, get everything else out of the way on the
unapplied stack (see
:ref:`section-review-patches-queues-walkthrough` for techniques).
Issue ::

    hg qnew <descriptive-name>

I am always in such a rush, I often forget this step. If you are
like me, then ::

    hg qnew -f <descriptive-name>

will capture your changes made so far and give you a patch to
work with.  The "descriptive-name" can be anything you like,
nobody else ever has to see it.  Use a Trac ticket number or
whatever you please. Edit, build, test, create documentation,
knock yourself out.  At any time, run ``hg qdiff`` to see your
changes.

Once satisfied with your work, use ``hg qrefresh`` to save your
changes into the patch.  Even better is to use the ``-e`` or
``-m`` switches to allow you to edit (or specify) a summary line
for the patch.  This was described above as the commit message.
The use of ``-m`` is illustrated below.  To create a patch file
in the proper format for submission to Trac, you need a generic
Mercurial command.  Your patch is at the "tip" of the Mercurial
repository and you want to export it, with redirection to a file.

::

    hg qrefresh -m "Trac 1234: modified matrix memory management mostly"
    hg export tip > ~/sage-patches/trac_1234_matrix_memory.patch

Now upload this to the ticket in the usual way.  Note the message
in the ``-m`` switch is what others will see as a description of
your patch, not the name you used in ``hg qnew`` initially.
*Do not use* ``hg qfinish`` when you think a patch is done, despite
the pleasing sounding name.  It will finalize your patch, add it
into the main repository, remove it from your queues, and
generally make it much harder to get back to with subsequent
edits based on reviewer comments.  Your work is not gone, but it
will take a few steps to get it out as a patch and back into the
queues.  You might want to read up on the command ``hg qimport -r`` as
a possible way to undo an accidental commit.

Of course, the minute you upload, you get a better idea about a
key step in your algorithm.  Simple---edit some more, then
``hg qrefresh`` (the message stays put, so you don't have to redo it),
and ``hg export tip > <filename>``.  You can use a new filename,
or recycle the previous one.  Trac will let you add a new file,
or replace the existing one with a file having the same name.

Suppose a reviewer suggests some changes.  You can just keep
editing the same patch, or you could ``hg qnew`` a second patch
on top of the old one.  It would depend on circumstances, there
are situations where either approach would make sense.

Suppose it takes a while for a reviewer to look at your patch.
Move it off into the unapplied stack with ``hg qpop`` and then
begin a new project with ``hg qnew <another-name>``.  Or leave
your patch in the applied queue and start something new that
relies on your first set of changes (again using ``hg qnew``).

So the sequence ``hg qnew``, ``hg qrefresh``, ``hg export tip >``
will create a new patch and allow you to easily amend or extend
it, or totally move it "out of the way" to do other things.


Upgrading Sage with queues present
----------------------------------

When it is time to upgrade Sage to the latest release, you need
to return your development version back to a virgin state.  Use
``hg qrefresh`` on whatever patch you are currently creating (if
any).  Then pop everything off the applied stack with ``hg qpop
-a``, where the switch ``-a`` means "all."  There you are, back to a
known good state.  Now use the standard commands to upgrade
Sage::

    cd SAGE_ROOT
    ./sage -upgrade

Sometimes for intermediate releases you will need a URL as an
argument to the ``-upgrade`` switch.  Check the Sage discussion
groups, where these locations are typically announced.  Now you
can ``hg qpush`` to put all your patches back onto the applied
stack in the same order.  Realize, however, that the upgrade may
have changed some of the source code where your patches have
changes.  Certainly, if you have patches you reviewed positively,
those exact changes may already be present (so at least ``hg
qdelete`` those patches before pushing everything back on).


The Big Picture for Mercurial queues
------------------------------------

At some time when you have a few patches applied, and a few
unapplied, run ::

    cd SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage
    hg qapplied
    hg qunapplied
    cat .hg/patches/series

The output of the two ``hg`` commands should together look just
like the output of the ``cat`` command.  The
``.hg/patches/series`` file has all of the names of your patches
in some order, and you can imagine a separator that splits the
list into the applied portion at the start of the file and the
unapplied portion at the end of the file.  (You can also use the
command ``hg qseries`` to see a list of all your patches.) The top of
each stack is on either side of the separator.  (So the order of each
stack runs in opposite directions in this file.)

The command ``hg qpush`` moves the separator toward the end of the
file, while ``hg qpop`` moves the separator toward the start of the
file.  Furthermore, ``hg qnew`` inserts a new patch on the side of the
separator toward the start of the file, while ``hg qimport`` adds
an existing patch on the side of the separator toward the end of
the file. Finally, ``hg qdelete`` totally removes a name from the
series file.

So what if you want to rearrange the order of your patches (in
either stack)?  Make sure to ``hg qpop`` until all the affected
patches are in the unapplied stack.  Open ``.hg/patches/series`` with
a text editor and rearrange the lines below the imaginary separator.
Save the series file and confirm the new ordering with
``hg qapplied`` and ``hg qunapplied``.  Then ``hg qpush`` repeatedly to
get to where you want to be.


More on queues
--------------

So with careful management of your queues and regular upgrades,
you can contribute to Sage easily, review others' patches, work
on several projects simultaneously, and so on, all with just a single
copy of Sage devoted to development.

If you know how "regular" Mercurial functions (and even if you
don't) you can look at the main Mercurial repository (with
``hg log | more``) and see how queues "insert" your applied patches
near the tip of the repository, all "behind the scenes."

The "record" extensions allow you to selectively pick (record)
portions of a patch to group together.  So you can round up
related bits and pieces of a patch if that makes sense in the
context of your work.  For more on record, qrecord and crecord, see

* http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RecordExtension

There are lots more you can do with queues, but you should
understand enough now to experiment safely. The following URLs
contain introductory tutorials on using Mercurial queues:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mercurial_Queues

The online book
`Mercurial: The Definitive Guide <http://hgbook.red-bean.com>`_
by Bryan O'Sullivan contains numerous examples on using
Mercurial. See especially Chapters 12 and 13 for explanation
on how to effectively use Mercurial queues.
