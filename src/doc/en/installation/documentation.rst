The Documentation
=================

You do not need to install the documentation separately: it is
included with Sage. This includes the tutorial, the manual, the
developer's guide, and this installation guide. The tutorial includes
a guided tour of Sage, and is a good staring point. The reference
manual describes what is available in Sage along with examples of how
to use it.

To build the HTML and PDF versions of the documentation, use the
command ``sage -docbuild {document} {format}``. For example, ``sage
-docbuild reference html`` builds the HTML version of the reference
manual; type ``sage -docbuild`` to see a list of all of the options.
