        libraries, and how to modify Sage's documentation. It also

        <span class="linkdescr">
        This is the manual for the Sage mathematical software
      system. The reference manual contains many examples that
      illustrate the usage of Sage. It consists primarily of
      documentation that has been automatically generated from the
      Sage source code.  The examples are all tested with each release
      of Sage, and should produce exactly the same output as in this
      manual, except for line breaks.

        Three Lectures about Explicit Methods in Number Theory Using
  Sage</a><br>

        <span class="linkdescr">This document is about using the
        mathematical software Sage to do computations with number
        fields and modular forms.  It assumes no prior knowledge about
        Sage, but assumes a graduate level background in algebraic
        number theory.</span></p>
