# Setup libcsage symlinks

## set up libcsage. this does two things: first,
## we build libcsage so that we can set up links
## to make the sage build work. second, since this
## is a new system, we need to get rid of old
## copies of c_lib files and put our symlinks in place
cd c_lib
scons -Q install
## always kill the libcsage, we remake the link below
rm -f "$SAGE_ROOT"/local/lib/libcsage.*

## let's go ahead and get rid of them all
